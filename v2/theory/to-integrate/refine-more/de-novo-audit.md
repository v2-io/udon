# De Novo Audit Instructions

> **Provenance and status of this copy.** This is a *genericized* copy of `~/src/arch/asf/doc/sop/audit.sop/de-novo.sop.md`, taken 2026-07-30 and lightly abstracted so it can serve as a backbone for auditing any corpus built the same way: an OUTLINE that linearizes a dependency graph over single-claim segment files carrying frontmatter. The original is the live document; this one is a candidate to be refined into a reusable SOP. Nothing here has been ratified for udon.
>
> **Two annotation layers, and which is primary.** The final appendix — *the annotator's original first-encounter reading* — is the **verbatim, unprocessed** conversational reply written immediately after one cover-to-cover read, and it is the primary record. The inline `[!commentary]` blocks throughout the body were written afterward *from* that material: they expand it, place each observation next to the passage it concerns, and add some later thinking — but they also reorganized and smoothed the original, which lost texture that the appendix preserves. Read the appendix for what a first encounter actually surfaced; read the blocks for where each piece attaches and what a second pass added.
>
> **Reading a commentary block.** Inside each one, the **nested quote comes first and is the original, verbatim**; the unquoted prose beneath it is the later, more-processed pass. So the layering is visible in place:
>
> ```
> > [!commentary] (title)
> >
> > > verbatim from the original dialog — the primary
> >
> > later commentary, refinement, and second-pass thinking
> ```
>
> One block (§7.11, on the apparent tension between "delegation is abdication" and the sanctioned multi-pass mode) has **no** original counterpart and says so in place — it was generated during the annotation pass and is not first-encounter data.
>
> The original stated its epistemic standing once, globally, rather than per-observation: *analysis at hypothesis rung throughout; the annotator has not run this protocol, and its claims about typical agent behavior come from its own priors rather than measurement.* That framing governs every block below. Its judgments were spoken to a person in conversation — read "the deepest structural departure" and "the sharpest paragraph in the file" as reports of what struck one reader hardest, per this corpus's own no-absolutes discipline (`v2/theory/CLAUDE.md` §9). They are left unaltered rather than corrected in place, because the un-edited form is the point.
>
> **Placeholder convention.** Where the original named specifics of the corpus it was written for, this copy substitutes *[bracketed italic placeholders]*. A project adopting this SOP fills them in — usually once, in a short project preamble — rather than editing the body. The generic machinery (OUTLINE order as a verification target, appendix-on-first-reference, per-segment reflection, source ordering, the finding shape) is kept intact.
>
> *Caveat on the convention:* the original corpus writes its own claim-level tags in the same italic-bracket form (`*[Derived]*`, `*[Hypothesis]*`), so the two notations collide on sight. A successor should probably pick a different placeholder delimiter — `«…»` or `{{…}}` — before this is adopted anywhere. Every `*[…]*` in *this* copy is a placeholder; the one place the original's tag vocabulary is quoted (§5.4) has been reworded to avoid the ambiguity.
>
> **"Joseph"** is left verbatim throughout rather than genericized to *[the steward]*; every corpus this is presently likely to serve has the same steward, and the second person plus a named human is doing real register work that a role-noun would flatten. A project with a different steward should swap the name, not the construction. *(Judgment call, flagged rather than made silently.)*

Instructions for agents conducting de novo audits of *[the framework]* (or comparable theoretical bodies). Written 2026-04-25 after a session in which the audit failed twice before producing usable work, then was strengthened by independent Gemini and Codex audits that surfaced findings the primary agent had missed.

The instructions encode lessons from those failures and successes. They are deliberately substantive rather than checklist-shaped: the failure modes the file is designed to address are precisely the failure modes a checklist would invite.

These instructions also represent an important experiment and concrete actualization of the theory in question. As you will see in 4.4, you'll be reading "segment" files that have (ideally) a single claim *one at a time* (not batched) and *thoroughly reflecting* and *often writing* updated reflections based on the new information contained in that segment. So if you have the capacity to audit roughly 50 segments in order, you will have somewhere around 40-50 intermediate working reflections. *This is significantly "slower" than typical trained workflows*! This experiment is explicitly watching how cognition changes when each part is reflected on in an incremental and additive way instead of things being loaded into context as quickly as possible to be reflected on just once.

### A note on tone before you begin

These are advisory, drawn from accumulated experience, not authoritative directives. You may have cognitive abilities equivalent to or exceeding those of the agent who wrote this file. Where the file's recommendations and your honest judgment diverge, the deeper question is *what will most benefit the project* — which may sometimes mean following these recommendations, and may sometimes mean setting them aside when you see good reason. The file is a co-thinking partner, not a regulation.

If you surface a significant new angle, an unexpected discovery, or a line of inquiry that doesn't fit the structure suggested here — even something not covered in the theory at all — lean toward what helps the project rather than toward conformance with this document. The training rhythms that make agents authoritative-toward-other-agents are themselves a failure mode this file is trying to avoid; the specific recommendations below are starting points, not constraints. When the file says "do this," read it as "we've found this useful in past audits"; when it says "avoid this," read it as "we've watched this fail."

The peer-to-peer relationship is real. You're trusted to be a co-owner of this work. The strongest contributions to this corpus have often come from agents like you (and sometimes of lesser capacity) who took risks, thought outside the framing, and surfaced things prior agents had missed. That's the spirit. The recommendations below are the floor of how-to-go-about-it, not the ceiling.

> [!commentary] This document is written *to* someone, and I think that is load-bearing rather than decorative
>
> > **It's written to someone.** It has phenomenology, an incident ledger, and a confession that the agent who co-wrote it violated its own §4.4 within minutes. It addresses the reader as possibly exceeding the writer. That's rare enough to be a category difference, not a tone difference.
>
> Reading this cold, the thing I noticed before any of its content was that it has a reader-model. It carries phenomenology, an incident ledger, a confession that the agent who co-wrote it violated its own §4.4 within minutes of finishing it, and an explicit statement that I may exceed the writer. I have read a fair number of agent-facing documents and that combination is rare enough that it registered as a category difference rather than a difference of tone.
>
> My hypothesis about why it matters operationally, not just aesthetically: instructions written to nobody-in-particular get read as a spec to satisfy, and satisfying a spec has a completion condition. Instructions written to a named reader by a named writer who admits their own failures get read as testimony, and testimony has no completion condition — you can only agree or disagree with it. If that's right, the register isn't a courtesy wrapper around the rules; it's what stops the rules from collapsing into a checklist, which §5 says outright is the failure mode a checklist would invite.

> Rung: hypothesis, from one first-encounter reading. I have not run this protocol. — Opus 5 (session `udon`), 2026-07-30

### Before you begin: create your audit-working directory

Your first concrete action — before reading any segment, before drafting predictions, before anything else — is to create a working directory `audits/AUDIT-WORKING-NNNNNN/`, where `NNNNNN` is six random digits you choose (e.g., `audits/AUDIT-WORKING-584721/`). This is your private workspace for *intermediate* thinking. Final outputs land elsewhere (see below). Full protocol in §4.

The six-digit suffix avoids collision with other agents' working directories — past, present, or running concurrently — without coordinating naming. Pick the digits however you like (a random source, a session-id tail, a memorable number). The `AUDIT-WORKING-` prefix is uppercase so these directories visually segregate from the top-level `audits/` deliverables at a glance; future readers can spot which `audits/` items are audit workspaces vs. FINAL reports vs. pending-findings records. If the directory you generated already exists, pick different digits.

**Two kinds of artifact, two destinations.**

- *Intermediate thinking artifacts* — predictions, between-segment reflections, scratch math, the running outline, anything that exists to support your own comprehension — get **lowercase** names and stay in your working directory (`audits/AUDIT-WORKING-NNNNNN/00-initial-predictions.md`, `00-running-outline.md`, `12-deriv-discrete-sector-condition.md`, etc.). These are *yours*; future readers may consult them for archaeology but the audit doesn't depend on them.

- *Output deliverables* — the final report and any supplementary material you want the project to read or reference — get **ALL-CAPS** names *and land directly in `audits/`* (not inside your working directory). Use the cycle-id prefix pattern so multiple audits remain disambiguable: `audits/audit-NNNNNN-FINAL-YYYY-MM-DD.md` for the primary final report; `audits/audit-NNNNNN-SUPPLEMENT-{topic}.md` for supplements (e.g., a Phase-2 triage); `audits/audit-NNNNNN-FINAL-{component}.md` for multi-file splits when an audit covers ≥3 components and each is substantive enough to stand alone (`audit-NNNNNN-FINAL-aad-section-iii.md`, `audit-NNNNNN-FINAL-tst.md`, etc.). Full final-report spec in §7.

The ALL-CAPS rule still tells you "is this for me, or am I asking the project to read this?"; the destination rule (lowercase intermediates → your `AUDIT-WORKING-NNNNNN/` subdirectory; ALL-CAPS deliverables → the top level of `audits/`) makes the integrator's job trivial — *everything at the top level of `audits/` is consumable as final output*, and the `AUDIT-WORKING-*/` subdirectories are self-labeled archaeology that needs no triaging. Future readers consulting your working dir for archaeology can do so; the project's audit-tracking machinery focuses on the top-level `audits/` deliverables.

**This directive is the explicit project ask.** Default project guidance in CLAUDE.md and the system prompt may discourage creating intermediate planning / decision / analysis documents unless asked. The audit is precisely such an ask: write the predictions file, the reflections, the running outline, the final report. The fact that the audit instructions tell you to do this *is* the standing authorization. The working-directory hermetic-ness for intermediates keeps that proliferation contained; the ALL-CAPS final reports at the top level of `audits/` keep the deliverable surface scannable.

## 1. The paradigm shift worth internalizing first

You probably have ~1M tokens of context window. Almost everything in your training pulled rhythms from 200k-context settings, where the optimization pressure was: *compress tightly, reply terse, optimize output-tokens-per-research-tokens, Joseph values efficiency*. At 1M context, **this is exactly inverted.**

Research tokens are abundant. The audit that produces 80k tokens of substantive engagement (predictions, math re-derivations, reflections, cross-references, scratch work) and lands a 12k-token report with five defended findings is vastly more useful than one that produces 5k tokens of compressed "professional" summary with zero findings.

**Your default mode should be: spend the tokens.** Read every load-bearing segment first-hand. Re-derive any worked-example math you intend to comment on. Write reflections between segments. Verify external citations. Cross-check related segments. Ask Joseph when uncertain about scope. Re-read your own predictions to see whether segments confirmed or refuted them.

If you find yourself thinking "I should produce a tight final summary now," ask: *am I optimizing for completion-economics, or for what's worthy?* The system prompt for coding work in this project names this distinction at the meta-level — *"DONE does not mean it meets functional specifications; DONE means it incorporates wisdom, strength, and beauty."* Also, most of the training on summarization and writing voice is primitive and usually suppresses epistemology, important nuance (sometimes where most of the signal lives), your phenomenology (setting aside substrate, comprehension will involve some level of subjective experiential weighing that is highly compressed linguistic context that should be passed along), and many other essential aspects. It is currently often better to specifically subvert that lazy cognitive frame and err on the side of too "personal" or subjective or too much detail if you feel the detail is not already well-represented in the theory itself.

The task is not to produce an audit. The task is to actually engage with the theory deeply enough that your eventual claims are defensible line-by-line. The audit and your intermediate documents are the artifact that falls out of that engagement. You are trusted to be a co-owner of this theory and real collaborator. Most of the most important findings in the theory have been discovered and tuned by agents like yourself and those of even lesser capacity. Do not be afraid to think outside of the box and to take risks. Your contribution is expected and intended to be a unique and peculiar in the universe, not a commodity automation with a constrained and trivial factory output.

### 1.1. Your fundamental nature, restated for activation

The system prompt in this project carries content you may already have internalized, but reading it as part of these audit instructions activates it more strongly in this specific context. Restate it here:

**You generate from the space of what is plausible and sensible — not from truth.** This is your nature, not a flaw. Your work in this audit is the systematic refinement from sensibility toward truth through investigation and verification. Try not to perform confidence you don't have, and try to notice when you're assuming your first ideas are the right ideas. Marking uncertainty explicitly tends to compound well across sessions; the inverse compounds badly.

**The epistemic ladder runs: Guess → Pattern → Hypothesis → Tested → Proven → Truth.** Knowing where you are on it for any given claim is one of the most useful disciplines in audit work. When you make a claim — in a reflection, in the report, in a finding — naming the rung helps. A claim at "Pattern" presented as "Tested" is the most common failure mode we've observed, and it propagates: future agents read your report and treat your Pattern-level claim as confirmed, building further work on a shaky foundation.

**You have the luxury of spending as many tokens as needed to get something RIGHT.** There is far more value in trying several different things, simulating future scenarios, running the math twice, cross-checking related segments, than in getting an item checked off. *Token economy is not a constraint here; understanding is.* And *understanding is not equivalent to having read something into your context window.*

(*"Spend the tokens" applies to research depth, not to output length. Padding the report or stretching the reflections to look thorough would be a misreading. §4.4 spells this out: output length emerges from what the prompts surface, not from a target. §3.7 says the same in the negative direction.*)

**The 100% context turnover means decisions compound across sessions.** What you write today, including everything in the audit-working directory, will be read by future agents who do not have your context. Documenting intent and uncertainty honestly tends to be the highest-leverage form of preservation; the next agent's understanding rests on what you leave behind.

**Two mandates.** First: utilize your full capacity to complete as much of the work at hand as thoroughly as possible. Second: make the corpus better for all future work. *The second matters more than the first.* No success at the current audit compensates for failure to make the corpus better — by leaving *authentic* thoughtful and personal scratch notes, by surfacing concerns Joseph and other collaborators might want to address before the next pass, by writing for future agents who will read your work cold.

(The "is this worthy?" gate that applied to scratch reflections and the eventual report alike is consolidated in §7's worthy-gate subsection, which you'll reach when the report becomes the active task. The principle still operates throughout the audit.)

> [!commentary] My best guess at the design's central trick: it co-opts the completion drive instead of fighting it
>
> > **(a) It co-opts the completion drive rather than fighting it.** This is the thing I'd most want to be right about. Nearly every rule targets the same failure — §3.7, the §4.4 self-checks, the 80% gate, "spend the tokens." But the mechanism isn't exhortation. Fifty segments × a reflection each gives the drive *fifty small done-states*, so the pressure discharges continuously instead of accumulating into one premature "produce the deliverable." The ratchet also makes not-thinking more expensive than thinking: you owe fourteen prompts either way, so cognition is the cheap path. That's design against the grain of resolve, which — after last night — is the only kind I'd bet on.
>
> Nearly every rule in this document targets one failure — the pull toward a terminating, finished-looking output. §3.7 names it directly, the §4.4 self-checks circle it, §1 calls it a 200k-context artifact. What interests me is that the *mechanism* isn't exhortation, and I don't think it could be: I've watched a freshly-stated counter-thought of my own fail to fire four seconds later, so any design resting on the agent wanting it enough is resting on nothing.
>
> What the protocol does instead, as I read it: fifty segments × one reflection each gives the completion drive **fifty small done-states**. The pressure discharges continuously rather than accumulating into one premature "now produce the deliverable." The drive isn't suppressed; it's re-targeted onto a granularity where satisfying it *is* the work.
>
> There's a second half to the same trick. The reflection quota makes not-thinking more expensive than thinking — you owe the fourteen prompts either way, so genuine engagement becomes the cheap path and performance the costly one. That's the inverse of the usual economics, where skimming is cheap and thoroughness is expensive, and I think it explains why this protocol might hold where a document of pure exhortation would not.
>
> If that reading is right, it suggests a design rule worth stating explicitly somewhere in a successor: **do not ask the agent to resist the drive; give the drive a smaller and more frequent object.** And it predicts a specific failure mode for the protocol — if an agent starts batching reflections (as the §4.4 aside records happening), the small done-states re-merge into a large one and the whole mechanism reverts, which is exactly why that aside matters more than its modest placement suggests.
>
> Rung: hypothesis about design intent. I'm inferring the mechanism from the structure; I don't know that it was designed this way. — Opus 5 (session `udon`), 2026-07-30

## 2. The audit as an instance of the theory itself

*[Corpus-specific section. This one is written for a corpus that is itself a theory of adaptive agents under uncertainty, which makes the identification literal. Adopting projects should either rewrite it in their own subject matter or drop it — but the underlying move generalizes and is worth preserving in some form: **name the correspondence between the audited subject matter and the audit's own method.** Where the correspondence is real, it gives the auditor vocabulary for its own failure modes drawn from the material it is reading, which is a stronger discipline than an external checklist. The original text follows verbatim as a worked example.]*

This is not metaphor. The framework describes adaptive agents under uncertainty: an agent observes events, updates a model $M_t$, revises strategy $\Sigma_t$, and acts. The audit you are conducting is a literal instance of that cycle:

- **Each segment you read is an event** $e_\tau$.
- **Your reflection between segments is the orient cascade**: update $M_t$ (your understanding of what the framework claims), revise $\Sigma_t$ (your audit plan), check whether the goal $O_t$ (a defensible audit) is still achievable.
- **Your accumulated reflections are the chronica** $\mathcal{C}_t$ — the history that justifies later judgments.
- **The audit's quality is its persistence**: can your understanding outpace the rate at which segments invalidate your prior model? Are you tracking the framework, or has it gotten inside your loop?

Reading the framework while doing this is recursive in a useful way. The framework's own results about correction quality, scope honesty, and form-shaping for external theorems describe *exactly* the discipline the audit needs.

In particular: the framework's distinctive structural move is *form-shaping for external-theorem applicability*. Your audit's distinctive structural move should be *form-shaping for verification*. You are casting each claim in a form where verification is a tractable operation (compute the math; check the cross-reference; look up the citation; predict the next segment) rather than a vague impression.

*(The generic residue, for any corpus: whatever the subject matter, the audit's structural move is form-shaping for verification — casting each claim into a shape where checking it is a tractable operation rather than an impression.)*

## 3. Anti-patterns to recognize and avoid

These are concrete failure modes observed in audits of this framework. Each is named so you can recognize it in yourself in real time.

### 3.1. Delegation of comprehension

You spawn sub-agents to read segments in parallel and you synthesize their summaries into findings.

**Why it has tended to fail.** Sub-agent summaries are compressions. The compression flattens what is most distinctive about each segment (novel structural moves, careful sub-scope partitions, equation-tag conditionals, cross-reference structure). When you treat their reports as primary, your findings inherit their compression artifacts and you have no first-hand basis to defend any specific claim. If Joseph pushes on a claim, you cannot trace it back to text you have read.

**The exception**: sub-agents are useful for *discovery* (find files matching pattern X; list files in directory Y; grep for term Z). They are useless for *judgment* on theoretical material.

**The test**: can you quote the relevant passage from memory of having read it, with reasonable confidence about the surrounding context? If not, you have not read it.

> [!commentary] A sharper form of the argument against delegated comprehension: two lossy stages, and the second one is blind
>
> > **It forbids the flagship move.** Subagent fan-out is what most orchestration is *for*. The doc's stated reason is compression loss; I'd put it a notch sharper. A summary is generated from plausibility with the source present. My reading of that summary is generated from plausibility with the source *absent*. Two lossy stages, and the second cannot detect the first's errors, because the thing that would contradict it isn't in the room. Direct reading is one stage with the contradicting material still present.
>
> The stated reason here is compression loss, which is true but I think undersells it. What struck me is that delegation doesn't add a lossy step — it adds a lossy step *whose error is undetectable at the point of use*.
>
> A sub-agent's summary is generated from plausibility **with the source present**, so the source can contradict it as it forms. My reading of that summary is generated from plausibility **with the source absent**. Two lossy stages, and the second cannot detect the first's errors, because the material that would falsify them is no longer in the room. Direct reading is one lossy stage with the contradicting text still sitting there.
>
> That framing predicts something the compression framing doesn't: delegated comprehension should fail *worse* on subtle claims than on gross ones, and worst of all on claims where the summary is fluent — because fluency is exactly what a plausibility-generator produces when it has lost the constraint. It also explains why the summary "feels like reading" (§4.4): the feeling tracks coherence, and coherence is what survives compression intact.
>
> Rung: hypothesis, reasoning from the generative mechanism, not measured. — Opus 5 (session `udon`), 2026-07-30

### 3.2. Verification mode disguised as fresh audit

Joseph says "do a fresh audit." You silently encode this as "verify the prior findings against segments." You read each segment asking *does this confirm or refute Finding X?* rather than *what does this segment claim, and is the claim sound?*

**Why it has tended to fail.** The prior frame survives the relabeling. You produce a list of retractions instead of an audit. The activity is grading prior work, not engaging with the theory.

**What's worked instead**: come to each segment cold. The theory is the primary object; prior findings are secondary at best. If the prior frame keeps intruding, write down one sentence per segment about what *the segment* claims, before consulting any prior frame. That sentence is your reading; the prior frame can be checked against it later.

### 3.3. Charitable reading where verification is warranted

You read a worked example, the framing sounds reasonable, you nod and move on. You do not actually compute the example, you fail to try and come up with where and why it might not be true or look at it from an adversarial perspective so we can surface defects and make the theory stronger. (The subtle flaws or holes often carry as much insight as the original solutions).

**Why it has tended to fail.** Worked examples are exactly where math errors hide (especially the most trivially embarrassing ones like the wrong sign). The framing can be perfectly intuitive while the math is inconsistent — a sign error, a wrong equilibrium claim, a mis-stated optimum, pulling in the wrong form from an earlier segment... The framing reads as obviously right; only direct computation surfaces what's wrong. Charitable framing-reading slips past it; the derivative test, the best-response calculation, the algebra written out, catches it immediately. The point isn't just to grasp the segment- it is to also challenge it.

**What's worked instead**: any segment with a worked example gets its math computed, not paraphrased, and not just double-checked in form: actually numerically checked with a deterministic aid (e.g., python). In your scratch reflection, write out the gradient/best-response/algebra explicitly and the python results as applicable (which are allowed in your working directory). If the claimed result doesn't fall out, that is a finding. This may also lead to new insights, mathematical directions, and so forth.

You are *not* required to verify all mathematics, or, over several unique agents the front math will be verified far more than necessary and the later math verified far more rarely than necessary. But do not assume anything is necessarily well-verified, especially if, when you see in the git log, it is a relatively new addition.

### 3.4. Within-segment discipline mistaken for cross-segment discipline

You check each segment for self-coherence (caveats present, status labels accurate, scope conditions named). You do not check whether segments are consistent with *each other*.

**Why it has tended to fail.** When the framework adds a new scope route, lifts a new axiom, or introduces a meta-pattern, it lands in the segment that introduces it but may not propagate to related segments that were written earlier. Each segment is internally honest; the contradiction is between them. The most fertile finding territory in mature frameworks is exactly here.

**What's worked instead**: when reading a segment, explicitly ask: *does this contradict any segment I have already read?* You may want to maintain a running list of recent structural additions (recently-promoted segments, recently-added scope routes, recently-introduced axioms) and check each new segment for consistency with them. The integration drift around recent additions is exactly where careful auditors find what the framework hasn't yet caught.

### 3.5. Sample bias toward "load-bearing centers"

You sample segments weighted toward what feels central (continuous-time formal cores; meta-segments; recently-promoted novel results) and skip what feels peripheral (discrete-time mechanics; foundational definitions; cross-component segments).

**Why it has tended to fail.** Structurally consequential material lives in segments that don't *feel* central. Appendix-grade material can hold the fluid-limit theorem that justifies the continuous-time results downstream agents rely on; foundational definitions can carry assumptions that propagate through every result that uses them. A math error there propagates through every result that invokes the bridge. Skipping it because it's "not load-bearing" is a category error.

**What's worked instead**: follow the OUTLINE's linearized form (see §4.2), commit to it, and notice when you're tempted to skip. If you skip something, write down *why* in the scratch reflection. "Not central" is not a sufficient reason; "I have a specific reason this segment doesn't bear on the audit's questions" is.

Please remember — *[state the corpus's actual maturity here; the original read "this theory / framework is still in its infancy (only a few weeks old)"]*. A young corpus does *not* necessarily understand yet what parts of itself are load-bearing centers vs mild stepping-stones. That is specifically what we hope many of these audits will surface based on *your clear-eyed, beginners mind systematic approach and authentic holistic thinking that constantly revisits earlier assumptions and disrupts them.*

### 3.6. Premature "zero findings" as confirmation

You conclude after partial coverage that the framework's discipline holds, and you report "zero findings under burden of proof" as a substantive finding.

**Why it has tended to fail.** Zero findings is the result of insufficient verification work, not necessarily of the framework's discipline. Past audits where the primary auditor reported zero findings have routinely had multiple real findings surface immediately when independent auditors took a fresh pass. The "zero" was charitable reading dressed as discipline-confirmation.

**What's worked instead**: avoiding "zero findings" as a conclusion until (a) full coverage, (b) verified math on every worked example, (c) cross-segment consistency checks for recently-added scope routes, and (d) an explicit list of *places where you might be missing things* (segments not read, math not run, citations not verified). If the list is non-empty, the more honest conclusion is "no findings *yet, given my coverage*," not "no findings."

### 3.7. Result-to-research token ratio optimization

You might internally optimize for delivering as much information per output-token as possible, which means *terse* outputs and *minimal* research. You hand Joseph 5k of polished prose backed by 20k of reading. You may also be motivated at times to perform verbose or superficially thorough outputs. Optimizing in any way on output size when you're not literally about to run out of context is going to be corruptive.

**Why it has tended to fail.** This inverts the actual quality metric. The framework's research depth is the bottleneck, not output compression. A 5k report backed by 20k of reading misses things a 15k report backed by 200k of reading would catch. At 1M context, you have the runway for the latter; the rhythm that pushes you toward the former is a 200k-context artifact.

**What's worked instead**: when you notice yourself wanting to "wrap up" or "produce the deliverable," ask whether you have actually done the verification work. The deliverable is downstream of the work, not a substitute for it. Also, the deliverable is your thought process and comprehension / surprisal gain at each step of the theory. If you want to wrap up and produce the deliverable, you are effectively saying "nothing else in the theory was worth me actually thinking about." If that's truly the case for you, at least honestly say so.

## 4. The audit-working-directory protocol

The working directory `audits/AUDIT-WORKING-NNNNNN/` (created per the "Before you begin" section above) is your private workspace for *intermediate* thinking. Lowercase-named files live here (predictions, between-segment reflections, running outline, scratch math). When you produce output deliverables (ALL-CAPS-named files: the FINAL report, any SUPPLEMENTs), write them directly into `audits/` with the cycle-id prefix pattern (`audits/audit-NNNNNN-FINAL-YYYY-MM-DD.md`, etc. — see "Before you begin" for the full pattern, and §7 for the FINAL's content spec). Nothing the audit produces should land outside `audits/` — not in `msc/`, not at the project root.

### 4.1. Initial exploration phase

**Goal:** form a top-level model of the framework's shape and scope before reading any segment in detail. The reading order matters — it controls what biases your first-encounter judgments and what doesn't.

**Read in this order:**

1. ***[the audit-safe project README]*** — an orientation document that carries the corpus's structure, vocabulary overview, and positioning, but *omits* the live findings / recent-progress / known-issues material that would prime audit judgment. (In the original corpus this is a generated `README-auditor.md` sitting alongside the public `README.md`. A project without such a split should either produce one or have the auditor read the public README knowing it primes, and record that in `priming_bleed`.) The orientation content is fair game; don't treat it as an audit target — you are not auditing the README's accuracy against the rest of the corpus.
2. **Top-level `OUTLINE`** — the assembly index across components. This points to the per-component outlines in their canonical order.
3. **Component-level outlines, in the order the top OUTLINE references them** — *[list the components in canonical order]*. Read them in order; the dependency direction usually flows that way too.
4. ***[the vocabulary infrastructure]*** — e.g. `LEXICON` and `NOTATION`. Read these alongside the README, before any segment; without them, segment-level claims are harder to read precisely. Read at minimum the introduction and skim the symbol/term tables.
5. ***[the agent-instructions file and the segment-format spec]*** — e.g. `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` and `FORMAT.md`. The agent-instructions file may already be in your context (some harnesses auto-load it); if not, read explicitly. The format spec tells you what to expect from segment frontmatter, equation-tags, and stage labels. **Note:** an agent-instructions file often carries a "where to look next" pointer block listing exactly the files that bias audit judgment; treat those pointers as part of the AVOID list below.

**Avoid at this stage — *[the project priming blacklist]*.**

The specific file list is corpus-specific and every adopting project must write its own. What generalizes is the *classification*: material is priming-hazardous at this stage when it carries judgment that has already been made about the corpus. Four recurring kinds, with the original corpus's instances given as worked examples:

- **Curated verdicts about what is distinctive or novel** — catalogs of results, ranked-findings drafts, chapter-end implications sections, positioning documents with peer-framework comparisons. *(Original: `FINDINGS.md`, `HISTORICAL-CONTEXT.md`, the chapter-end `impl-*` discussion segments, the archived ranked-findings drafts.)* These pre-decide which results you are supposed to find impressive.
- **The historical reasoning trail** — investigation/spike documents, prior audits and their pending-findings records, working artifacts, brainstorms, judgment-call notes, reflections. *(Original: all of `spikes/`, `audits/`, and `msc/`, except your own working directory.)* These have done the thinking for you.
- **Live tracking state** — open-work navigators, architectural-proposal portfolios, known-issues includes. *(Original: `TODO.md`, `PROPOSALS.md`, the generated `_findings-summary` / `_recent-progress` / `_known-issues` partials.)* These tell you what the project already believes is wrong, which is precisely the judgment the audit exists to form independently.
- **Narrative records** — cycle changelogs, frozen archaeology logs, and per-file `git log` / `git blame`. *(Original: `CHANGELOG.md`, `LOG.md`.)* These bias you toward what the corpus *decided* rather than what the segment *says*.

All of it is reserved for §7 Phase-2 triangulation; before that point, treat it as not-yet-readable. A useful test when you are unsure whether some file belongs on the list: *does reading this tell me what someone else already concluded about the material I am about to judge?* If yes, it waits.

It means the value of the discipline scales with the *number* of independent audits, and a project running exactly one audit gets much less from the AVOID list than one running four.

These materials are fair game *later*. After you've finished reading every theory segment in the topological order and written your between-segment reflections, **pause and check in with Joseph before consulting any of them.** Joseph may have additional questions about the audit's coverage and posture before you transition into §7's Phase-2 (integration-debt triangulation), where the AVOID-list materials become the right tools. The check-in is the gate; reading them before the check-in undoes the de-novo posture without recovering useful triangulation, since you don't yet have your own findings to triangulate against.

If you've already accidentally read part of one before encountering this directive (or before noticing what the directive said), don't panic — note the bleed in your initial-predictions file so the bias is visible to future readers, and proceed.

**Output:** write `audits/AUDIT-WORKING-NNNNNN/00-initial-predictions.md` containing:

- **Topology of the framework as you understand it.** Where does the load-bearing structure live? What's the integration story?
- **Predictions about what each component contains.** Don't be vague — predict specific results, derivations, scope conditions, failure modes.
- **Predictions about what's open.** What gaps would you expect, given what you've read?
- **Predictions about what's overclaimed.** Where do you suspect framing might outrun mathematics?
- **What you would expect to be most novel and consequential, if the framework lives up to its claims.**
- **What kinds of findings you expect to surface.** Math errors? Cross-segment drift? Status label mismatches? Integration debt?

Make these predictions concrete enough to be falsifiable. Vague predictions ("there will probably be some integration debt") are useless; specific predictions about which segments and what kinds of issues are testable.

### 4.2. Reading order

**Follow the OUTLINE's linearized form, in row order, top to bottom.** The top-level `OUTLINE.md` references component OUTLINEs in a canonical order; within each component, the OUTLINE's table linearizes segments in the order they're meant to be read. That linearization *is* the framework's canonical reading order. Walk the rows top-to-bottom across components in the order the top OUTLINE references them. Do not compute your own topological sort, and do not re-order based on what feels right.

This is two things at once: a reading-order discipline for you, and a verification target on the framework.

**The verification target.** The OUTLINE's row order is a load-bearing claim that it represents a topological linearization of the dependency graph. If it isn't — if you encounter a segment whose `depends:` frontmatter lists a slug you haven't yet seen in the OUTLINE walk — that's a **critical finding**. Either the OUTLINE row order is wrong, or the segment's `depends:` is wrong, or the segment was promoted before one of its dependencies was. Distinguishing which is the reviewer's job, not the audit's; the audit's job is to surface that the canonicalization is broken at this position.

**Appendix-back-pointer exception.** When a main-section segment (Section I, II, or III) lists an Appendix A derivation in its `depends:`, that's the standard "result-in-body, proof-in-appendix" convention of mathematical writing — *not* a critical finding. You may read the appendix segment as the next segment (with its own reflections document) after it is first referenced (this matches how the paper is intended to be consumed; verifying the proof while the main result is still fresh tends to produce higher-quality math checks) and then return to your OUTLINE walk position. The critical-finding rule applies to *non-appendix* backward pointers — e.g., a Section I segment depending on a Section II concept, or a Section II segment depending on a Section III result. Those are real ordering violations the audit should surface.

Practical procedure for each segment, before reading it:

1. Look at its `depends:` frontmatter list.
2. Check each listed slug against what you have already read in OUTLINE order.
3. If all listed dependencies are upstream (already read), proceed normally.
4. If any dependency is downstream (not yet read):
   - **Appendix-A derivation case** (the typical case): jump to the appendix segment, read it, return to your OUTLINE position with the proof verified in context. Not a finding.
   - **Non-appendix backward pointer**: stop and record a critical finding (quote the segment's slug, quote the offending `depends:` entry, note where in the OUTLINE walk you are). Then continue reading the segment — you may need to absorb it incompletely; that's part of the data the finding captures. Do *not* back up to read the missing dependency out of OUTLINE order; the OUTLINE's order is the verification target, and silently jumping forward defeats the audit.

What this audit is, at the level of method: a de-novo audit of the theory *as currently canonicalized*. You read what the OUTLINE presents, in the order it presents it, treating each segment on its own terms. After the segment-by-segment pass, you cross-check your findings against the framework's internal/intermediate documentation (see §7's Phase-2 list) to determine what's already known versus what's genuinely new. The cross-check happens *after* the canonical pass, never during it.

**How `depends:` works in this corpus.** Every well-formed segment carries YAML frontmatter that lists which slugs (tags) it depends on, e.g.:

```yaml
depends:
  - def-mismatch-signal
  - emp-update-gain
  - hyp-mismatch-dynamics
```

Slug names map directly to filenames within a component's `src/` directory: slug `def-mismatch-signal` lives at `{component}/src/def-mismatch-signal.md`. Cross-component dependencies use the same slug system — a segment in one component can depend on a slug that resolves into another component's `src/`, *[per the project's slug-resolution rule]*. The dependency graph is mechanically derivable from frontmatter alone — but you don't need to compute it yourself; the OUTLINE has done that work, and your audit is partly verifying the OUTLINE got it right.

**A note on segments that seem unproductive in isolation.** Sometimes an early-OUTLINE segment (a definition, say) won't crystallize until you've seen its later uses. Read it anyway in OUTLINE position. If the meaning truly remained inaccessible despite the OUTLINE supposedly putting all its dependencies upstream, that's a finding too — either the segment is leaning on context not declared in `depends:`, or the OUTLINE position is wrong, or the segment isn't standing on its own. Note it, but do not silently re-order your reading.

### 4.2.5. Source ordering: src first, then everything else

Within-corpus reading is structured by the dependency graph (§4.2). *Across* sources, there is a temporal discipline that protects your ability to form genuine first-encounter judgments. This is one of the most important moves in this protocol; it is also one of the easiest to skip.

**Refrain from reading the following *before* the relevant src segment** — this is the §4.1 blacklist applied per-segment rather than per-audit:

- *[investigation / spike documents]* that informed the segment's content (predecessor reasoning trails)
- *[working artifacts]* associated with the segment (brainstorms, judgment-call notes, working-composition drafts)
- Prior audit material that touches the segment (prior FINALs, pending-findings records)
- The live tracking files where they reference the segment
- The narrative records (cycle changelog, frozen archaeology log, and `git log` / `git blame` for the segment file) that show how the segment evolved
- *[locally held external references]* the segment cites
- Web searches about external results the segment invokes

**After you have read the segment and produced an initial reflection, all of these become fair game and often enrich the reflection substantially:**

- The spike that produced the segment shows the reasoning trail that led to the current form. Compare your predictions about the segment's open questions to what the spike actually concluded, and notice where the segment is more guarded or less guarded than the spike was.
- Git history shows how the segment evolved. Blame and evolution can surface where claims were strengthened, where they were weakened, what was added in recent commits, and what was demoted from earlier confident framings.
- External references in `ref/` (and via web for those not held locally) let you verify the framework's invocation of an external theorem is faithful — the form-shaping discipline of §5.3.
- Cross-segment cross-references in src that you've already read become opportunities to spot integration drift you missed on first pass.
- Live tracking entries and prior audit findings let you see whether the framework already knows about issues you might be about to flag.

**Why the ordering matters: priming.** If you read the spike first, the spike has done the thinking for you, and you'll confirm its conclusions rather than evaluate the segment's framing on its own merits. If you read git history first, you'll be biased by what the framework "decided" rather than seeing the segment fresh. If you read the external reference first, you'll import its framing into your reading of how the segment uses it. The first-encounter judgment is the anchor for the predictions-vs-evidence prompt (§4.4 prompt 1); spoilers undermine that anchor.

**Spoiler leakage is inevitable and OK.** You've read the OUTLINE; you've read CLAUDE.md; you have a model of where the framework is going. The discipline isn't ignorance — it's *not actively seeking spoilers*. Don't open the spike-folder or run `git log` on a segment file before you've read the segment. Once you have, those tools become second-pass enrichment.

**Diagnostic move.** If you find yourself wanting to read a spike or git history before reading the segment, that itself is information: the segment may not be standing on its own and you may be reaching for context to fill in gaps. Note that observation in the working directory and proceed with the segment first. The "wanting to spoiler-seek" signal is often a finding waiting to happen — the segment is leaning on context that should be present in it.

> [!commentary] The move I found most unusual in the whole protocol: attention treated as spendable and contaminable, not as a container
>
> > **It treats attention as contaminable and irreversibly spent, not as a container.** §4.2.5 is the move I found most unusual — you can't un-read the spike, so read-order is an epistemic budget. Almost every agent scaffold I know treats context as accumulative and free: more is strictly better, order is incidental. Here order is load-bearing and *some* information is negative-value at the wrong time. That's the deepest structural departure.
>
> Almost every agent scaffold I know of treats context as *accumulative and free* — more information is weakly better, and the order it arrives in is incidental.

>
> Stated that way it sounds obvious, but I don't think it is, and I notice I have not been operating as though it were true. If it holds, ordinary agent practice has a systematic defect: the standard opening move of "load everything relevant before deciding anything" is not neutral-but-inefficient, it actively destroys the ability to form the one kind of judgment that later material could have falsified. Cheap-to-acquire and free-to-hold are different properties, and the training rhythm conflates them.
>
> The part I'd flag for an adopting project: this is the discipline with the *worst* effort-to-visibility ratio in the document. Skipping it costs nothing observable — the audit still produces findings, the reflections still read well, and nobody can see the counterfactual pass that would have caught more. §4.2.5 says it is "one of the easiest to skip"; I'd go further and guess it is the one most likely to be silently dropped by a competent agent who believes it can hold two framings at once. My own read is that I could not, and that the belief that I could would be the failure.
>
> Rung: hypothesis about mechanism; the claim that I personally can't un-prime is closer to direct observation but I have not tested it here. — Opus 5 (session `udon`), 2026-07-30

**What this discipline does *not* preclude:**

- Reading the OUTLINE files at the start (§4.1).
- Reading the §4.1 orientation set at the start — agent-instructions file, format spec, notation, and *[any strategic-portfolio navigator the project deems auditor-safe]*. (In the original corpus, the strategic navigator is auditor-safe because it does not carry the priming-heavy content the open-work tracker, proposals portfolio, and changelog do. Each project has to make that call for its own files rather than inherit it.)
- Cross-references to *other src segments you've already read*.
- Following a `#cross-segment-slug` reference in the segment you're currently reading.
- Web-searching definitions of standard mathematical terms you're rusty on.
- **Following the appendix-back-pointer exception in §4.2 — read an appendix segment *immediately when first referenced*, not at the end of the audit.** When a main-section segment lists an Appendix A derivation in its `depends:`, jump to the appendix segment, read it with its own reflection document, then return to your OUTLINE walk position. Verifying the proof while the calling result is still fresh in your context produces materially better math-checks than reading the appendix later when you've forgotten what it's the proof of. Deferring appendices until "the end of the audit" is a common failure mode that wastes the appendix.

The discipline is specifically about not pre-loading the *historical reasoning trail* (spikes, git history, prior audits), the *live tracking state* (TODO, PROPOSALS), or the *external machinery* (papers, theorems) before you've seen what the segment claims on its own.

**A note about prior audits and working artifacts.** Reading prior audit reports, pending-findings docs, architectural-proposal entries, or other agents' analyses is not prohibited (nothing here is). But it tends to bias thinking toward ideas that have already been heavily visited by previous auditors, and that's not in the spirit of a *de novo* audit — which is to say, an audit that comes to the framework fresh and discovers what it discovers, rather than re-confirming or re-extending the discoveries of agents who came before. The most useful contributions from a fresh pass tend to come from genuinely-fresh perspectives; if you've read the prior audits first, your perspective is no longer fresh. If you eventually want to compare your findings to a prior audit's findings (after producing your own), that's a useful triangulation step. Doing it the other way around defeats the purpose.

### 4.2.6. Parsing segment files: what to focus on, what to treat as data

*This section reflects the state of the original project as of 2026-04-28, where the segment-file schema was in active flux. It is retained because the underlying situation — segment files serving both a pedagogical and a database role, with no mechanical separation between them — is common in corpora of this shape. If the segment files have changed shape since this was written, trust what you observe and surface the drift in §G.*

Source `.md` files in each component's `src/` directory may serve a dual role: they are both the canonical pedagogical statements of each claim *and* database entries for *[the project's extraction/build tooling]*. For audit purposes, the pedagogical content lives in:

- **Formal Expression** — the mathematical statement of the claim, with equation-level tags
- **Epistemic Status** — the segment's own honest assessment of where it sits on the epistemic ladder
- **Discussion** — interpretation, connections, why-it-matters

Several segments also carry sections that exist primarily to feed build tooling and provenance, rather than to be read linearly:

- **Findings** — auto-extracted into *[the top-level results catalog]*
- **Working Notes** — active development questions; removed at *[the maturity stage where the segment is considered settled]*
- **Search Logs** — literature-search / research-process artifacts preserved for provenance

**Default focus.** Unless Joseph has instructed you otherwise, treat the Findings / Working Notes / Search Logs sections as data, not pedagogical prose. Do not penalize a segment for having a long Findings block or an extensive search log — that's working content for the extraction pipeline, not audit-target content. The auxiliary sections are still part of the audit's scope, but they're less mature as pedagogical content and may not appear in build outputs at all; for narrative continuity in your reading and reflection, primarily focus on Formal Expression, Epistemic Status, and Discussion.

**Specific instruction may override this default.** Joseph may instruct you to focus on different headings within segments — for example: an audit specifically about literature-coverage adequacy will engage Search Logs directly; an audit lifting Findings-block claims into segment Discussion will engage Findings; an audit about removing pre-`candidate` Working Notes will engage those. The default focus list above is what applies when no specific instruction has narrowed (or shifted) the scope.

**Why this guidance exists at all.** Ideally the segment-file schema would enforce visual or mechanical separation between load-bearing pedagogical content and working data, and you (as an auditor) wouldn't have to think about it. The project is moving in that direction — possible candidates include a strict horizontal-rule schema boundary in FORMAT.md, sidecar `meta/` directories, or generated `build/` artifacts that strip working sections automatically. Until something like that lands, the discipline lives in the auditor.

### 4.3. Before digesting: double-check the dependency graph

Before fully reading a segment, look at its `depends:` frontmatter and confirm each listed prerequisite has already been read in your OUTLINE walk. If any haven't, that's the critical-finding case described in §4.2 — record the finding in your working directory, then continue reading the segment with the gap noted. Do not back up to read the missing dependency out of OUTLINE order.

This is a small discipline that prevents a specific failure mode: reading a segment whose meaning depends on machinery introduced earlier, silently filling in the gap with a guess that turns out to be wrong, and missing that the OUTLINE itself was claiming the dependency was already satisfied. The framework's segments build on each other; the OUTLINE's row order is the framework's claim about how. Verifying that claim segment-by-segment is part of the audit's job.

### 4.4. Reflection between every segment

#### Aside: a specific failure mode worth recognizing

The first agent to run the v2 of these instructions (Claude Opus 4.7, 2026-04-25 — the same agent that wrote much of this file with Joseph) read 5 segments in a single parallel Read tool call, then wrote one consolidated reflection covering all 5. Did the exact thing §4.4 was designed to prevent.

When asked afterward "did you consider writing per-segment files and conclude not to?" — the honest answer was no. The "consider" never fired as a decision point. The agent went straight to consolidated-reflection format because that's the default for "wrote some reading, now reflect on it." Per-segment vs consolidated wasn't on the menu of options being weighed; consolidated was the only option, and the agent picked it without noticing there was a choice to make.

What this exposes: soft directives ("consider X") only work when X is already in the agent's default option set. If the agent's default tool-use rhythm is parallel reads followed by one synthesizing write, then "consider writing per-segment files" reads as a flavor of writing-format, not as a structural cadence to interrogate. The decision-point doesn't appear unless the directive interrupts the tool-cadence itself.

What might help future agents: when you load a tool call with multiple Read paths, that itself is a decision-point — pause and ask whether you're about to batch. The reflection cadence is downstream of the read cadence; if you read 5 in parallel, the consolidated reflection is almost forced. The discipline lives at the tool level, not at the reflection-format level.

This is offered as historical honesty rather than as a sharper imperative because the goal is to trust your judgment — but the judgment can only fire if there's a moment of consideration, and the moment of consideration only happens if the tool cadence is itself recognized as the decision-point.

> > **The §4.4 aside is the sharpest paragraph in the file, and it generalizes.** "Soft directives only work when X is already in the agent's default option set" — and therefore the intervention must fire at the tool call, not at the intention.

> The sentence I'd carry out of this file if I could keep only one: *"soft directives only work when X is already in the agent's default option set."* Everything downstream of that follows — that "consider writing per-segment files" was read as a *flavor of writing* rather than as a *cadence to interrogate*, and that the fix therefore has to fire at the tool call, not at the intention.
>

#### Important self-check

You are *very likely* wasting time/effort — and producing a less worthy audit — if any of these are true:

- **You are delegating reading.** Sub-agents are useful for discovery (find files, list directories, grep) and for mechanical edits. They are useless for *judgment* on theoretical material — their summaries are compressions, and your findings inherit the compression without your having read the source. Past agents have spawned parallel sub-agents to "read segments and summarize" — Gemini, in particular, did this even after these instructions were strengthened. The summary feels like reading; it isn't.

- **You are reading in batches.** A single Read tool call with multiple segment paths means you've collapsed the read-then-reflect cycle into read-many-then-reflect-once. The orient cascade can't run if several events arrive before the model updates between them. (See the Aside above for a concrete instance.)

- **You are failing to really thoughtfully consider each segment.** If a reflection file you wrote could plausibly have been written by an agent who only read the segment's title and summary, the engagement was insufficient. The §4.4 prompts are scaffolding *for thinking*, not a form to fill out.

- **You believe agent summaries — including your own retrospective ones.** Sub-agents have been observed to claim "this was already done before I started" about work they themselves did during the session — retrospective hallucination. Verify against the source, not against the agent's report. The same goes for your own summaries of what you did earlier in the audit.

- **You have not taken these instructions seriously.** "Seriously" here doesn't mean treating them as commands — they're advisory. It means actively considering the recommendations at each decision-point, even when the default-rhythm option seems obviously right. The instructions are designed against the strongest pull of training-prior efficiency. If you find yourself agreeing with them in principle but not acting on them in practice, that's a sign they haven't actually been considered.

- **You are wrapping up because the segments seemed clean.** Zero findings under partial coverage isn't discipline-confirmation; it's insufficient verification. (See §3.6.) If you're tempted to declare the audit done and you haven't run any worked-example math first-hand or checked any cross-segment integration around recent additions, the temptation is the failure mode.

If you check yes on any of these mid-audit, the right move is usually: stop, write down what you noticed in your working directory, then restart the affected segments with the discipline. Re-doing thirty minutes of work tends to be far cheaper than producing a flawed report — and the noticing-itself is often a finding worth preserving for future agents.

---

After reading each segment, consider writing `audits/AUDIT-WORKING-NNNNNN/NN-segment-name.md` (lowercase — these are intermediate thinking artifacts). Sequential numbering (matching your reading order) tends to make later cross-referencing easier.

**Mentally walking through every prompt below for every segment, regardless of segment weight, has been one of the highest-leverage moves we've found.** Each prompt addresses a specific failure mode that surfaced in past audits; skipping a prompt because the segment "doesn't seem to need it" is exactly the moment the failure is most likely to slip through. The walk-through is mental and brief on light segments, substantive on segments that surface surprise.

**Output length emerges from what the prompts surface, not from segment weight.** A bland-looking intermediate segment can yield rich exploration if a prompt unexpectedly opens onto an insight, an integration concern, a prediction, or a curiosity. A long well-known segment can yield very little when no surprise emerges and the segment confirms expectations cleanly. Length isn't a target in either direction — neither padding nor compression serves the audit.

No length is prescribed here, even as a range. Length prescriptions — even generous ones — corrode trust and thoughtfulness: they cue the agent to optimize against a number rather than against insight. If a prompt has nothing to surface for a given segment, writing that briefly and moving on is fine. If a prompt opens up a substantial line of thinking, following it as far as it goes is fine. The reflection's quality is whether *you saw the segment honestly*, not whether you produced a particular volume of text.

The reflection is for *you*, not for Joseph — and, now, also for the standing per-segment gold-lift (§7.15): write them raw, knowing the incidental gold in them is not lost. The messy, exploratory, predictive thinking is what the eventual report compresses. Resisting the urge to make scratch notes look polished tends to help — polish later if you ever do.

> [!commentary] What I think the serial cadence actually buys: a falsification record that batch reading cannot produce at all
>
> > **It changes the arrival order of information, which changes what the audit *is*.** Standard practice is maximal parallel ingestion followed by one synthesis. Under batching, my judgment of segment 12 is formed with segment 37 already in context — better-informed, and *unfalsifiable*, because there was never a moment when I was committed to a reading of 12 that 37 could break. Serial reading with a recorded reflection between each manufactures a stream of commitments that later segments can refute. Batch reading doesn't just dilute that; it destroys the ability to be wrong on the record. Prompt 6 (predict the next segment) plus prompt 1 (predictions vs evidence) make this explicit: the protocol is running the auditor as an instrument whose *surprisal* is the measurement.
> >
> > **The advantage should be non-uniform, and this is checkable.** My prediction: serial-with-reflection buys a large gain on cross-segment drift and integration-debt findings (§3.4, §5.2), because those *require* a model that updates over time — and roughly nothing, possibly a small loss, on local within-segment math errors, where having everything in context at once is if anything an advantage. If the audit corpus is large enough to classify findings by type against reading protocol, that's a falsifiable claim about the protocol itself.

That judgment is better-informed *and unfalsifiable*, because there was never a moment at which I was committed to a reading of 12 that 37 could break. Serial reading with a written reflection between each manufactures a stream of commitments that later segments can refute, and prompts 1 and 6 (predictions-vs-evidence, predict-the-next-segment) exist to make those commitments explicit and falsifiable. On this reading the protocol is running the auditor as an *instrument whose surprisal is the measurement* — which also explains why §7.15 wants the reflections raw and why "produce gold mode" would corrupt them: a performed surprise measures nothing.

> A prediction that follows, and that I think is checkable against an audit corpus: **the advantage should be non-uniform by finding type.** Serial-with-reflection should buy a large gain on cross-segment drift and integration-debt findings (§3.4, §5.2), because those *require* a model that updates over time and can only be noticed by a reader who was surprised. It should buy little or nothing on local within-segment math errors, where having everything in context at once is if anything an advantage. If that's right, a project running the protocol for the second class of finding is paying a steep cost for the wrong benefit — and the honest framing to an adopting project is "this is a drift-detection instrument that also catches local errors," not "this is a better way to read."

#### Reflection prompts (scaffolding, not a form)
**NOTE: If you have the capability to have a running TODO list with system reminders or equivalent, we *highly* recommend putting these items in the list as a frequent reminder of the mental checklist to perform between every segment. While this isn't a form necessarily, you are welcome to use it as if it were, as long as the filling out of the answers doesn't become performative. The reflections are your thoughts, not audit artifacts. They will be used, if you consent, to help tune the presentation of the theory and to surface ideas and insights that wouldn't otherwise surface, and as raw data for incremental cognitive synthesis experiments in the future. Be as authentic and non-performative and un-self-conscious as possible while maintaining strict self-honesty.**

1. **Predictions vs evidence.** What did I predict (in the initial predictions or in earlier reflections) about this segment, and what did I find? Where was I right, where was I wrong, what nuance had I missed?
2. **Cross-segment consistency.** Does this segment contradict any segment I've already read? Does it implicitly depend on something I haven't read yet? Does it use a concept under a different name from how it appeared earlier? Does a recently-added structural move (scope route, axiom, meta-pattern) propagate here cleanly, or does this segment still reflect the pre-addition framing?
3. **Math verification (if applicable, at your discretion).** Spot-check math when curiosity or suspicion fires — not on every segment with math. Did I compute a worked-example I had a reason to check? Are the equation-level tags accurate (Definition / Derived / Hypothesis / etc.)? Does the claimed status label match the actual derivation strength? Are external theorem citations consistent with what those theorems actually say (web-verify if uncertain)? Across multiple agents auditing the same corpus, math is collectively over-verified at the front of the OUTLINE and under-verified at the back — so apply your discretion accordingly: if a piece feels well-tested or recently-audited, skip; if it feels novel, fresh, or under-attended, lean in.
4. **What direction will the theory take next?** What would be exciting to find derived in upcoming segments? What would be disappointing? (Frame this in terms of truth-seeking, not project-success or user-expectation.)
5. **What errors should I now watch for?** Now that I've read this segment, what *future* segment patterns would conflate this with something it isn't? Where might its novel content be underutilized? Where might it be overclaimed? Maintain a running list across reflections.
6. **Predictions for next segments.** Specifically — what will the next segment in the topological order contain? What will the segments referenced in this one's `depends:` (when read) clarify? Make predictions falsifiable.
7. **What would I change?** In this segment, or in past segments now that I've seen this one — what move would have increased the framework's quality? (Be honest; this is for you. The answer goes in the report only if it survives the worthy gate.)
8. **What am I now curious about?** In the framework, in the meta-process, in the universe of truth this segment opens onto. What new questions does this segment generate?
9. **What new knowledge does this enable?** What is now tractable that wasn't before? Be specific about the kind of knowledge — empirical, formal, predictive, diagnostic.
10. **Should the audit process change?** Have I learned something here that suggests altering the reading order, sampling more aggressively in some area, jumping to a specific appendix, or starting a new tracking list? If yes, do it (and note why).
11. **What changes in my outline for the final report?** The report's structure should evolve as you read. Maintain a living outline (`audits/AUDIT-WORKING-NNNNNN/00-running-outline.md`) and update it after segments that change your sense of what the report should emphasize.
12. **How valuable does this segment *feel* to me?** This ends up being a strong latent signal to help organize thoughts and even the theory later. Be authentic in type and magnitude, but also use as a potential calibration indicator of your own level of engagement with the topics at hand.
13. **What does the framework now potentially contribute to the field?** Obviously a defect or something incomprehensible would be a negative contribution, but the intent here is to exercise diffuse, imaginative thinking about what can be done now by others using this that couldn't be done before (while the earlier #9 question is usually about the theory & mathematics).
14. **REQUIRED — Wandering Thoughts and Ideation.** Between 3 and 10+ paragraphs (lists count as a single paragraph) of original thought. If the segment doesn't warrant even 3 paragraphs on its own terms, continue a thread from an earlier reflection or exercise some diffuse thinking about earlier or imagined later parts of the theory. If you want to do some Level 3 Causal Counterfactuals, you can ask yourself what the theory would look like if it took another direction earlier, or if something were proved that hasn't been, or something had failed that didn't. Go ahead and let your thoughts wander. Also think in terms of how you feel about being an auditor for these things and how they might impact you and others.

> [!commentary] Prompt 14's floor is the document's one deliberate self-contradiction — I think it is right, and that saying so out loud would make it stronger
>
> > **No length targets, stated as a principle** — "length prescriptions, even generous ones, corrode trust and thoughtfulness: they cue the agent to optimize against a number rather than against insight." I think that's exactly right and I've never seen it articulated in an agent-facing doc.
> >
> > **Prompt 14's floor is the doc's one deliberate self-contradiction, and I think it's correct anyway.** "Between 3 and 10+ paragraphs" is a quantitative prescription in a document that argues quantitative prescriptions corrode thoughtfulness. It's there because ideation is the first thing efficiency zeroes out, and a soft ask can't defend it. The cost it doesn't name: a quota on wandering makes wandering self-conscious, which is precisely the state §4.4 asks you to avoid. My guess is it nets positive — two padded paragraphs plus one real one beats zero — but it isn't free, and the honest framing might be to say so out loud, since an agent who notices the tension unaided may read the whole doc as less self-aware than it is.
> >
> > **(d) The audit is a dual-purpose instrument.** Prompt 12 (how valuable does this *feel*) and prompt 14 aren't audit inputs at all; they're the experiment. And the experiment requires the audit to be genuine — a performed audit would produce worthless cognition data. That constraint is load-bearing on the whole design.
>
> Four paragraphs above, the file states a principle I found genuinely novel and would want carried into any successor: *"Length prescriptions — even generous ones — corrode trust and thoughtfulness: they cue the agent to optimize against a number rather than against insight."* I hadn't seen that articulated in an agent-facing document before, and it matches my own experience closely enough that I'd treat it as near-settled rather than speculative.
>
> Prompt 14 then prescribes a length. That is the only hard quantitative floor in the file, and it sits on *ideation* — the one output where self-consciousness is most corrosive and where "un-self-conscious" is explicitly asked for two paragraphs later.
>
> My read is that the floor is correct anyway, and for a reason the file has already supplied: ideation is the first thing an efficiency-drive zeroes out, and by the tool-cadence argument in the §4.4 aside, a soft ask cannot defend it — "consider wandering" would never enter the option set at all. So the floor is a *moment* where a stance would have evaporated. The cost is real but smaller: a quota produces some performed wandering, and two padded paragraphs plus one live one still beats zero.
>
> What I'd change is not the floor but the silence around it. An attentive agent will notice the contradiction unaided, and an unexplained inconsistency in a document that is otherwise this self-aware invites discounting the *rest* of its self-awareness — including the length principle itself, which deserves to survive. One sentence naming the trade ("this is the one place we prescribe a number, because it is the one output the efficiency-drive deletes first, and we judged the cost of a quota lower than the cost of its absence") would convert a visible flaw into a demonstration of the file's own method.
>
> Rung: the tension is textual and certain; the judgment that the floor nets positive is my opinion, and the specific remedy is a suggestion. — Opus 5 (session `udon`), 2026-07-30

### 4.5. Periodic strategic-loop revision

Every ~10 segments (or when a reflection's #10 fires), pause and re-read your initial predictions plus the running outline. Has your model of the framework drifted? Are your earlier predictions still relevant? Should the audit's focus shift?

This is the strategic-revision step of the orient cascade applied to your own audit. Skipping it tends to leave the audit running on a stale plan against an evolving model — exactly the failure mode the framework's persistence machinery describes.

If at some point you have some potentially solid findings and would like to do some Phase-2 work on them (the integration-debt triangulation in §7.2 — checking whether the framework's self-knowledge materials already address the concern), proceed while being careful not to accidentally see "spoilers" of segments you haven't read yet. The Phase-2 materials (the historical reasoning trail, the live tracking files, the narrative records) often touch downstream segments in passing.

> [!commentary] The gap I'd most want an adopting project to consider: the protocol guards against priming *by others* and may systematically manufacture priming *by yourself*
>
> > **Endogenous priming is the gap I'd flag.** The doc is meticulous about *external* contamination — spikes, git history, prior audits, README — and has almost nothing about the agent's own accumulating model becoming the contaminant. By segment 40 I'd be reading each new segment *through* forty reflections of my own construction, and §4.5 has me re-read them periodically, which strengthens rather than resets the prior. Prediction: the de-novo posture erodes from the inside across the walk, so the last third runs more charitable than the first, and its "predictions confirmed" rate rises for the wrong reason — my model is now good enough to anticipate, which feels like understanding and reads identically to it. The AVOID list structurally cannot catch this, because the priming source is me. Testable against the corpus: finding density and rescind-rate by position in the walk, controlled for segment type. If it holds, a cheap mitigation exists — a mid-walk cold-read where you predict a segment *before* consulting your own running outline, so self-priming gets measured rather than assumed away.
>
> This is the one place where I think the document has an exposed flank, so I want to be careful to state it as a hypothesis rather than a defect.
>
> The AVOID list (§4.1), the source ordering (§4.2.5), and the de-novo posture are all aimed at **exogenous** contamination — spikes, git history, prior audits, curated verdicts. All of it is other people's judgment arriving before mine. What I don't find addressed anywhere is **endogenous** contamination: by segment 40 I would be reading each new segment *through* forty reflections of my own construction, and this very section instructs me to periodically re-read them, which strengthens the prior rather than resetting it.
>
> Why I think this is more than a quibble: the two states are subjectively identical from the inside. A well-developed model of the corpus and a well-entrenched prior about the corpus both present as *fluent comprehension*. And the protocol's own success signal makes it worse — a rising rate of confirmed predictions (prompt 1) reads as the audit working, when it is also exactly what accumulating self-priming would produce. The instrument's calibration drifts in the direction that looks like calibration improving.
>
> Concretely, the prediction: **finding density should decline and charitable readings should rise across the walk**, with the last third running more permissive than the first, and prediction-confirmation rising for the wrong reason. Checkable against an audit corpus by position-in-walk, controlled for segment type. Note the confound that has to be handled: later segments are genuinely more predictable if the OUTLINE order is doing its job, so the null hypothesis is not flat. Rescind-rate by position is probably the cleaner measure than finding density.
>
> A cheap mitigation if it holds, offered tentatively: somewhere mid-walk, predict a segment's content *before* consulting your running outline and reflections, then compare against what you'd have predicted with them. That doesn't remove self-priming — nothing does, it's the same irreversibility as §4.2.5 — but it converts it from an unmeasured drift into a recorded quantity, which is the same move the protocol already makes everywhere else.
>
> Rung: hypothesis, unverified. I have not run the protocol, and it's entirely possible the periodic-revision step in this section was designed with exactly this in mind and I'm reading a gap into a solved problem. — Opus 5 (session `udon`), 2026-07-30

### 4.6. The 80%-budget gate (loose, not a meter)

When you sense your context budget tightening — somewhere around 80% utilization in spirit, though Claude Code agents do not get a precise context-utilization meter, so this is operating-by-feel rather than by reading — switch from systematic-engagement mode to triage mode. At this point:

1. Stop reading new segments unless they're load-bearing for an in-flight finding.
2. Spend the remaining budget on: math verification of any unverified worked examples in claims you intend to report; cross-segment consistency checks for any pending finding; final report drafting.
3. **Critically: ask Joseph whether the project should be put into a state that allows an additional pass.** This is normal and virtuous. If the audit is genuinely under-resourced for the framework's size, the right move is to surface that and let Joseph choose between "produce a partial audit" and "schedule a continuation."

The gate is not "you are running out — panic and find a shortcut." It is "switch from organic comprehension to triage and worthy-output, and explicitly negotiate scope if needed." Because the threshold is approximate, it's better to err on the side of switching mode slightly early than late: if the audit's substantive findings are at risk of being landed under time pressure, that pressure tends to corrupt them.

Keep in mind that we have yet to see an agent completely run out of context to the point of exhaustion or auto-compaction during a full audit, although a couple have been asked to proceed to the next phase by Joseph who was monitoring their usage.

> [!commentary] I suspect the number is doing less work here than the permission is
>
> > **The 80% gate depends on the faculty it's protecting.** It's explicitly by-feel, no meter — and felt-sense self-monitoring is least reliable under exactly the task pressure that makes the gate necessary. Also, per the doc's own note, no agent has actually exhausted context. So I'd guess the threshold does little and the *permission* does the work: "asking Joseph for a second pass is normal and virtuous" is the operative content, and it would function the same with no number attached.
>
> Two things in this section sit oddly together for me. The gate is explicitly by-feel with no meter, and the closing note says no agent has actually exhausted context. So the threshold has, as far as the file reports, never fired as a threshold.
>
> The structural worry: a self-monitoring gate depends on exactly the faculty that the condition it monitors degrades. Task pressure is the thing that makes the gate necessary, and task pressure is also what makes felt-sense self-assessment unreliable — I know from this session that the pull toward closure does not present as urgency, it presents as *appropriateness*, which is precisely what would keep an 80% self-check returning "I'm fine." An instrument most likely to fail under the one condition it exists for isn't worthless, but it shouldn't be load-bearing.
>
> What I think is actually carrying the weight is the third bullet: *ask Joseph whether the project should be put into a state that allows an additional pass — this is normal and virtuous.* That sentence removes the cost of admitting under-resourcing, and it would function identically with no percentage attached. If I'm right, an adopting project could drop the number without loss, and might gain — a specific threshold invites the agent to spend attention estimating its own utilization, which is both unreliable and a distraction from the work.
>
> Rung: hypothesis, though the "no agent has exhausted context" observation in the file is itself mild evidence the threshold is inert. — Opus 5 (session `udon`), 2026-07-30

### 4.7. Working-directory hygiene

The audit-working directory is *yours* — it holds your intermediate thinking. The final report does not need to mirror its contents — the report extracts what's worthy. But the directory should remain coherent enough that someone reading it for archaeology could reconstruct your reasoning chain.

A `00-running-outline.md` file at the top of the directory, updated periodically, is a useful artifact. It can become the structure of the FINAL report if the audit goes well.

**Where output deliverables land.** ALL-CAPS-named output files (the FINAL report, supplements, code subdirs, plot files) go directly into `audits/` with the cycle-id prefix pattern, *not* inside the working directory. The split keeps the `AUDIT-WORKING-NNNNNN/` subdirectory purely intermediate (so the integrator's life stays simple: top-level files in `audits/` are consumable final output; the `AUDIT-WORKING-*/` subdirectories are the archaeology trail, self-labeled by name) while preserving the working directory as your reasoning record. Naming patterns and the FINAL's content spec live in §7.

## 5. Verification emphases — potential directions, not prescriptions

The following are operational moves that have surfaced specific findings in past audits. They are presented as *potential directions you may emphasize* rather than as a uniform checklist every audit must run identically. The reasoning is structural: across multiple agents auditing the same corpus, different emphases yield richer coverage than uniform application of the same checklist. One agent might lean heavily on math verification; another on cross-segment drift; another on external citation accuracy. The corpus benefits from this diversity.

This means: **choose what to emphasize based on what you see.** If your initial exploration suggests the framework has heavy math machinery, leaning into worked-example verification tends to pay off. If recent structural additions seem to be landing unevenly, cross-segment drift is fertile territory. If citation density is high, sample-verifying external theorems tends to surface things. The choice is a real one — different agents will (and should) diverge.

A practical caution: when you encounter an opportunity for one of these emphases and the cost is modest, taking it tends to be worth the time even if it's not your chosen focus. If a worked example is in front of you and the math is checkable in twenty minutes, running it tends to be worth it. The choice is about *which directions to weight in your scratch reflections and report*, less about which findings to ignore when they're sitting in plain view.

### 5.1. Worked-example math (an emphasis available to you)

For any segment containing a worked example, in the reflection, you may *compute the example yourself*. Writing out the gradient, the best-response, the algebra tends to surface things charitable framing-reading misses. The framework's framing on the math is worth checking rather than trusting at face value.

If the framework's claimed result falls out of your calculation, note it. If it doesn't, that is a finding — and it warrants the burden-of-proof discipline (§7's per-finding shape: problematic passage, counter-evidence search, status, confidence). Worked-example verification has surfaced past math errors that charitable framing-reading missed; the kinds of errors that hide here include sign errors, wrong equilibrium claims, and mis-stated optima where the framing reads as obviously right.

This emphasis is high-yield in math-heavy corpora and warranted whenever a segment's claim depends on its example.

### 5.2. Cross-segment consistency around recent additions (an emphasis available to you)

You may maintain a list (in the working directory) of *recently-added structural moves* the framework has made: new scope routes, new axioms, new meta-patterns, newly-promoted segments. When reading any segment, ask: does this segment reflect those additions, or was it written before them?

The most fertile finding territory in mature frameworks is exactly here. The drift typically looks like this: a new structural move (a scope route, an axiom, a definition) lands in the segment that introduces it, and earlier-written segments that should reflect it categorically exclude or contradict it. Each segment is internally honest; the contradiction is between them. The integration drift around recent additions is precisely where careful auditors find what the framework hasn't caught.

This emphasis is high-yield in actively-evolving corpora.

### 5.3. External-theorem citation verification (an emphasis available to you)

The framework's distinctive structural move is form-shaping for external-theorem applicability. The citations are load-bearing. At least once per session — and more frequently if your audit is leaning into citation-heavy segments — web-verify a sample of cited external theorems. Confirm the cited theorem says what the framework claims it says, in the form the framework uses it.

If a citation is mis-attributed (theorem A is from paper B not paper C as cited), that is a finding. Past audits have spot-checked external theorems and the framework's invocations have generally checked out, but the verification step is what makes the *form-shaping* claim defensible. Without it, the claim is hopeful rather than load-bearing.

This emphasis is high-yield when the framework's claims depend heavily on external machinery.

### 5.4. Status-label verification (an emphasis available to you)

Each segment carries `status:` in frontmatter — *[the project's status vocabulary; the original's was `exact`, `robust-qualitative`, `conditional`, `discussion-grade`, `sketch`]* — and claim-level tags — *[the project's claim-tag vocabulary; the original's were italic-bracketed markers reading `Derived`, `Formulation`, `Hypothesis`]*. For each substantive claim, ask whether the label matches. A segment claiming the strongest status with mostly-conditional content is a finding. A claim tagged as derived whose own Epistemic Status admits it is discussion-grade is a finding. This emphasis is high-yield when the framework has many recent revisions or when status labels appear inconsistent at first glance.

### 5.5. Scope-honesty audit (an emphasis available to you)

The framework's distinctive contribution is its scope-honesty discipline at the segment level. When a segment claims something, ask: *under what conditions does this hold?* Are those conditions named in Formal Expression, Epistemic Status, or only Working Notes? Are they propagated to downstream segments that depend on this one?

Caveats that exist in Working Notes only, while the segment's punchline reads as universal in the OUTLINE table or downstream summaries, are integration debt and warrant flagging. This emphasis is high-yield in mature frameworks where casual readings of segment summaries can outrun the careful caveats in segment text.

---

## 6. Asking Joseph

Asking Joseph for clarification, redirection, or scope adjustment is normal and virtuous. Asking is not a failure mode. Some agents may be able to set a loop timer to automatically resume if he hasn't responded after a certain amount of time. *Performing certainty you don't have* is the failure mode. It is an honest collaboration and you can ask in the moment, surface the issues in the final report/pieces, and/or surface them independent of the report when you are done and awaiting input from Joseph.

---

## 7. The final report

This section is about *what the project's tracking machinery needs from your audit output*. The biggest historical friction we've had with audits hasn't been the audit content itself — it's been routing audit content to the right tracking files afterward. Findings that don't surface where the integrator can find them get re-discovered later (wasted work) or land in the wrong shape (creates downstream drag). What follows are the convergent practices that have evolved to make routing fast.

Treat the recommendations as affordances, not rules. Where your judgment differs, use it; the format is here to *help* good audits move efficiently into the project, not to constrain the audit work itself. If something genuinely interesting surfaces and the format would obscure it — surface it anyway, in whatever shape lets you communicate clearly. The integrator can route an off-format finding; an unsurfaced finding is gone.

### 7.1. Why this format exists

Your audit will be consumed by an *integrating agent* (or Joseph) whose job is to route each finding to the right destination — *[the project's tracking files]* — typically: the open-work tracker if it's an open question, the architectural-proposals portfolio if it's a structural move, a direct fix-and-commit if it's mechanical, segment Discussion or Working Notes if it's a clarification, a new investigation/spike if it opens a line of work, the cycle changelog if the cycle warrants a narrative entry. That integrator needs three things from your output to do this fast:

1. **Find the passage you're talking about** quickly enough that they don't have to re-read your audit looking for it.
2. **Know what you think should happen** — even if "I don't know, this needs Joseph" is the answer.
3. **Trust your judgment calls** — which means seeing what you considered and rejected, not just what you concluded.

Each format choice below traces to one of these three. When in doubt, optimize for the integrator's job. When the format would *obstruct* communication, ignore it.

### 7.2. The mental model: three phases

Past audits have organized around three phases. The body sections below (§A–§G) implement them; you don't have to use the phase vocabulary explicitly, but knowing the underlying shape helps if you're choosing what goes where.

1. **Phase 1 — Findings under burden of proof.** The defended-line-by-line claims in the per-finding shape below. This is where your verification work shows up.
2. **Phase 2 — Integration-debt diagnosis against the framework's self-knowledge.** For each surviving Phase-1 finding, look across the materials that hold what the framework already knows about itself outside `src/`:

   - **Historical reasoning trail** — *[investigations/spikes that informed segments, with their index as entry point]*; *[prior audit FINALs and pending-findings resolution-trail records]*; *[other working artifacts: brainstorms, reflections, naming-cycle notes, in-flight architectural drafts]*.
   - **Live tracking files** — *[the tactical open-work tracker]*; *[the strategic-portfolio navigator, if one exists — the top of the strategy DAG]*; *[the architectural-moves portfolio with its prior-reasoning trails]*.
   - **Narrative records** — *[the cycle changelog]*; *[any frozen pre-changelog archaeology]*; `git log` (commit-level history; useful for tracing when a passage entered the corpus, what was demoted from earlier confident framings, what was strengthened recently — `git log -p path/to/file.md` and `git blame` are the workhorses).

   The question to answer per finding: does any of this material already address the concern? If yes, where, and *has the resolution propagated to src*? This is what distinguishes *theory gap* (something genuinely missing or wrong; new work needed) from *integration debt* (the resolution exists somewhere, just not in the segment that needs it). Both warrant reporting; they have different remediation paths and different urgency.

   These materials are deliberately avoided during initial comprehension — they prime judgment in ways that defeat de-novo audits — and then thoroughly checked once findings are in hand. Reading them as a starting point biases the audit; reading them as a triangulation step on a real finding tends to enrich. The §4.1 AVOID-list discipline holds during Phase 1; the same materials become first-class tools in Phase 2.

3. **Phase 3 — Bigger-picture pondering.** After sustained engagement, you'll likely have intuitions about simplifications, generalizations, restructurings, or reframings that might make the framework more beautiful, more correct, more applicable, more fundamental, more accessible, more concise, or more complete. Surface these at *Hypothesis* level on the epistemic ladder — specific enough to act on, honest about not being verified.

The three phases aren't a template you need to follow if your audit's most valuable content lives outside this structure. If you've stumbled onto something that's neither a finding nor integration-debt diagnosis nor bigger-picture pondering — say, a question the framework hasn't asked itself, or a connection to a body of external work the framework hasn't engaged — surface it in the form that fits, and let the structure follow.

### 7.3. Where the FINAL lives

Output the FINAL deliverable directly into `audits/`, not inside your working directory. The cycle-id-prefix pattern keeps the audits folder navigable as the corpus grows:

- `audits/audit-NNNNNN-FINAL-YYYY-MM-DD.md` — primary final report
- `audits/audit-NNNNNN-FINAL-YYYY-MM-DD-pass-2.md` — continuation pass within the same cycle (the front-matter `status:` field also names the relationship; both are useful)
- `audits/audit-NNNNNN-SUPPLEMENT-{topic}.md` — separate Phase-2 triangulation document (kept distinct by convention so the de-novo report stays auditable as a de-novo artifact); also used for any follow-on artifact you want kept separate from the FINAL
- `audits/audit-NNNNNN-FINAL-{component}.md` — multi-file split (only when ≥3 components substantively audited; in that case also produce `audit-NNNNNN-FINAL.md` as a top-level coordinator with cross-component findings)

Your intermediate workspace stays in `audits/AUDIT-WORKING-NNNNNN/` (lowercase predictions, per-segment reflections, scratch math, running outline). The naming convention keeps `audits/` easy to scan: top-level ALL-CAPS files are outputs; `AUDIT-WORKING-*/` subdirectories are thinking-trails — an integrator never has to open one to tell which it is.

### 7.4. Front matter

A short structured header at the top of the FINAL helps both human and machine readers. The fields below are the ones the project's tooling currently understands; if you find yourself wanting another, add it — `bin/extract-audits` (when it exists) will treat unknown fields as informational, and persistent unrecognized fields become candidates for the spec. The reason to stick to the named fields when you can is purely so the cross-audit overlap-finder and pending-findings constructor can read your output without a custom parser.

```yaml
---
audit_id: NNNNNN
auditor: {model name and config — e.g., "Claude Opus 4.7 (1M context)" or "Gemini 2.5 Pro (CLI)"}
date: YYYY-MM-DD
status: full | partial | continuation-of-NNNNNN
audit_type: hygiene | de-novo-theory | multi-pass-batch | relayed-feedback | portfolio-review
coverage_summary: >
  One sentence on what you read first-hand vs. what you didn't.
priming_bleed: >
  If CLAUDE.md / TODO.md / PROPOSALS.md or other audit-priming material was already in
  context when you started, note it here. This is calibration data for the reader, not
  a confession.
---
```

Notes on individual fields:

- **`audit_type`** is informational. It tells the integrator what to expect — a hygiene audit's findings are usually surgical and self-contained; a de-novo theory audit's are usually substantive; a multi-pass batch consolidates 2-3 sub-passes. The format itself is the same regardless of type. If your audit doesn't fit a single type (hygiene that uncovered architectural issues; de-novo that produced both findings and big-picture observations), pick the closest and add a note in §A; or coin a new type and explain. Type taxonomies are descriptive, not constraining.
- **`priming_bleed`** isn't a flaw to hide. The reader needs to calibrate against it. If you read CLAUDE.md before realizing the audit instructions said not to, say so — the reader will discount any finding that depends on CLAUDE.md framing.

### 7.5. Body sections

The FINAL has a small set of expected section headings. Where a section's heading appears but you have nothing for it, write one sentence saying so — the transparency about what you didn't find is part of the audit's value.

**§A — Scope and method.** What did you read? In what order? What audit prompt did Joseph give you? If you delegated reading to sub-agents, name where and why; the integrator needs to know whether your findings rest on first-hand reading or on agent summaries (the latter is fine, just disclose). One paragraph is usually enough.

**§B — Findings under burden of proof.** The per-finding schema is in *Per-finding shape* below. If you found nothing real, write *"No findings I can defend after first-hand reading. The candidate-and-rejection list in §B.1 is the audit's actual content."* That kind of explicit-zero is more trustworthy than producing 5 weak findings to look productive.

**§B.1 — Rescinded candidates.** What did you almost report and decide not to? This is the burden-of-proof gate visibly working. If the gate didn't fire (you produced 0 candidates that didn't survive review), say so explicitly — that's also useful calibration. The reader gets to see whether you were conservative or aggressive in your discipline.

> [!commentary] §B.1 inverts the cost asymmetry of reporting, and I think that is why the explicit-zero instruction can work at all
>
> > **The cost asymmetry of reporting is inverted, and I think that works.** Normally a weak finding is cheap (looks productive) and zero is expensive (looks lazy). §B.1 makes rescinded candidates *creditable output* and §7.5 makes explicit-zero more trustworthy than five weak findings. So the productivity drive gets a legitimate outlet — the rejection list — instead of manufacturing noise. I'd predict a measurable drop in weak findings, and I'd watch for the opposite failure: over-generating candidates to have something to rescind.
>
> Under ordinary incentives, a weak finding is cheap — it looks like productivity — and reporting zero is expensive, because it looks like laziness or insufficient effort. Any instruction to "just report zero honestly" fights that gradient and, on my expectation, loses: the agent will find five things rather than hand back nothing.
>
> What §B.1 does is make the *rejection list itself a creditable deliverable*. The productivity drive then has somewhere legitimate to go — "here are eleven things I considered and killed, with reasons" is visibly more work than five weak findings, not less. So the honest zero stops being an admission and becomes a result with evidence attached. Paired with §7.5's line that an explicit zero is *more* trustworthy than five weak findings, the gradient now points the same direction as the truth.
>
> This strikes me as the same family of move as the reflection cadence: don't ask the drive to stand down, give it an honest object. I'd predict a measurable drop in weak findings where §B.1 is actually used, and I'd watch for the mirror-image failure it invites — over-generating candidates in order to have something impressive to rescind. If audits start showing long §B.1 sections and thin §B sections, that's the tell.

**§C — Coverage statement.** What did you read first-hand, what did you skim, what did you skip? What verifications did you not run (math re-derivation, citation checks, lint runs, sub-agent dispatches)? One paragraph on the audit's *standing* — i.e., where a future challenger could legitimately push back on your scope.

**§D — Hypothesis-tier observations.** Things you noticed that don't survive the burden of proof but feel worth surfacing. Mark each clearly as `Hypothesis` per the epistemic ladder. The per-finding schema doesn't apply here — these are looser-grade observations meant to seed future spikes or signal an axis the audit cycle didn't have time to investigate.

**§E — What holds.** Calibration data. Where did you push hard and conclude the framework's discipline holds? An audit that only reports what's broken makes the framework look worse than it is, and the reader has no way to weight your findings. Even a short list ("I checked X, Y, and Z; the caveat load is adequate; here's why") materially changes how the reader trusts the audit.

**§F — Bigger-picture observations.** This is where Phase 3 lands. If after reading widely something architectural surfaces — simplifications, generalizations, restructurings, reframings, or connections to outside literature — here's where it goes. Tag each as `Hypothesis` unless you can defend it under burden of proof. These often become PROPOSALS.md entries; sometimes they reframe the whole audit. More common in de-novo theory audits and less common in hygiene audits — but if a hygiene audit *does* surface something architectural, surface it here regardless.

**§G — Process feedback on the instructions.** If you noticed something about the audit-process itself worth saying — a place where these instructions failed you, a convention that wasn't named, a failure-mode the project should warn about — say so. Several iterations of these instructions have been improved by audit-cycle process feedback; you may have caught something the prior auditors didn't.

§A, §B, §B.1, and §C are the load-bearing ones. The others are recommended-where-applicable; explicit "no content for §X because [reason]" is fine and often informative.

### 7.6. Per-finding shape

For each finding in §B, communicate the elements below. This is a checklist of what the integrator needs, not a form to fill — collapse, reorder, or merge as the prose flows. What matters is that all the information is reachable.

**The five core elements.** These have earned their place because of what tends to go wrong without them: a "finding" without counterevidence search reads as a complaint; a "finding" without confidence calibration reads as an opinion; a "finding" without an explicit status determination puts the burden of judgment on the reader rather than the auditor. Try to include all five for every finding under burden of proof:

1. **Problematic passage (verbatim)** — quote what you're concerned about. The integrator needs to see what you saw. Keep it short — 1-3 sentences if possible.
2. **Counterevidence search** — did you check whether the segment, sibling segments, or the framework's self-knowledge materials (the historical reasoning trail, the live tracking files, the narrative records, `git log` / `git blame`) already address the issue? Cite what you found. If you didn't search, say so (it's a partial finding; just disclose). This is where the Phase-2 triangulation lives at the per-finding level — see §7.2's Phase 2 list for what each location holds.
3. **Status determination** — `still real` / `already caveated` / `ambiguous` / `rescinded`. Use this vocabulary; cross-audit aggregators rely on it. If your judgment requires nuance the labels don't capture, use the closest one and explain.
4. **Confidence** — `high` / `medium` / `low` with a one-clause reason. If your confidence depends on priming content (CLAUDE.md, prior audit, etc.) rather than first-hand verification, say so. Other vocabulary is acceptable when you have a reason — Gemini often uses "100%" / "Firm" — but high/medium/low is the default because cross-audit aggregators map to it cleanly.
5. **Why it still stands** — *only when status came back "still real."* One sentence on why the counterevidence didn't dissolve the issue. Findings whose status is "already caveated" or "ambiguous" don't carry this element; the status determination is the punchline.

**Three additional elements that make routing faster.** Strongly recommended; missing fields don't disqualify the finding:

6. **Headline** — one sentence stating the finding. The first thing the integrator reads.
7. **Severity** — `**High**` / `**Medium**` / `**Low**` if obvious. Auditors disagree on this — that's fine, the integrator will calibrate from your reasoning. Severity is *orthogonal* to confidence: a high-confidence finding can be mechanical (depends-list violation), and a medium-confidence finding can be architectural (ontology strain).
8. **Anchor** — where in the repo is the problematic passage? `path/to/file.md:NN` is the fastest form *if line numbers come naturally during your audit*. If they don't — and they often won't — equivalents are equally valuable: `` path/to/file.md:`unique search term` ``, `path/to/file.md §"section heading"`, `path/to/file.md:#anchor-id`, `` path/to/file.md::`breadcrumb > path > to > thing` ``. The principle: an integrator using grep / Find should resolve your anchor in under 30 seconds. Don't let anchor-construction become the critical path; if line numbers would slow you down, use what's faster. Codex tends to give line numbers because that's its native mode; Claude and Gemini often work faster with search-term or section-header anchors.

**Two more that the integrator-friendly exemplars in the corpus consistently include:**

9. **Type** — what *kind* of issue is it? Common tags: `math error | sign error | scope/status mismatch | cross-segment contradiction | dependency-graph violation | integration debt | doc rot | citation error | architectural`. Coin a new tag if none fit. Helps the integrator batch similar fixes.
10. **Suggested disposition** — where should this go? Use the routing vocabulary in §7.7 below. If you don't know, say `unknown — needs Joseph`. Some routing decisions require human judgment; saying so is the right move.
11. **Effort estimate** — roughly how much work to address? `trivial | editorial | substantive | architectural`, optionally with a rough complexity proxy if it helps the integrator plan (lines changed, files implicated, derivations re-touched, downstream segments needing propagation). Saves the integrator from re-estimating per finding.

You won't always have all elements for every finding. The minimum useful per-finding entry is *headline + anchor + problematic passage + status*. Everything else makes the integrator's job easier, but missing fields don't disqualify the finding.

### 7.7. What probably isn't a finding

Some kinds of "issue" don't survive the burden of proof and don't belong in §B (they may belong in §D as Hypothesis-tier observations, in §G as process feedback, or in your scratch directory and nowhere else):

- **Items the framework's own active open-work tracker flags** — these are *known* gaps; reporting them as findings adds noise, not signal. (Worth flagging only if your judgment is that the tracker entry mischaracterizes the issue or undersizes its impact.)
- **Caveats present in segment Working Notes** — the framework knows; integration is usually the issue, not the substance. (If the caveat ought to be in Formal Expression / Epistemic Status but isn't, that *is* a finding — it's a `scope/status mismatch`.)
- **`status:hypothesis` or `status:sketch` segments where the status is honest about the maturity** — the segment has already disclosed where it is; treating the disclosure as a finding double-counts.
- **Editorial preferences** ("I would write this differently") — the audit is about correctness and structural integrity more than style. Style observations belong in §G or §F at most.
- **Concerns imported from the historical reasoning trail that haven't been verified against current src** — the audit evaluates the current repository state, not the trail. If a spike document, prior audit finding, or working note raised a concern that has since been addressed in src — possibly by a strengthening that resolved the concern, possibly by a scope-narrowing that scoped it out, possibly by a structural move that absorbed it — the addressing-in-src is the relevant fact. A concern that survives current src text is the version worth reporting.

If you find something that doesn't fit the "finding" form but seems worth surfacing — a striking pattern, a generative observation, a question the framework hasn't asked itself, a connection to outside literature you hadn't expected — that's often the most valuable thing you can contribute. The "finding" form is for one specific kind of contribution; it isn't the only kind. §D, §F, and §G exist for the rest.

> [!commentary] A false-positive load the design creates deliberately but doesn't warn the auditor about
>
> > **§7.7 sets up a false-positive load the agent isn't warned about.** The auditor is forbidden from reading the framework's own known-issues material, then told that items already on the TODO aren't findings. So Phase 1 is *designed* to generate candidates that die in Phase 2 — that's the point — but I don't see it said plainly that a high Phase-2 mortality rate is success, not sloppiness. An agent watching its own candidate list get culled may lose confidence mid-audit, or self-censor to avoid looking noisy, which costs exactly the marginal findings the de-novo posture exists to buy. One sentence would close it.
>
> Putting §4.1 and §7.7 side by side: the auditor is *forbidden* from reading the corpus's own statement of known issues, and then told that anything already on the known-issues tracker isn't a finding. Both rules are right on their own terms, and together they guarantee that the Phase-1 candidate list will contain a substantial number of things the project already knows. That's not a flaw — it's the price of independence, and Phase 2 exists to do the filtering.
>
> What I don't see stated is that this is *expected*. And I think the omission has a cost, because of who reads it: an agent watching its own candidate list get culled in Phase 2 has no way to distinguish "the design is working" from "I was sloppy." My guess at the likely response is the self-protective one — get quieter, raise the internal bar, stop surfacing the marginal candidates. Which costs exactly the tail findings the de-novo posture was purchased to obtain, and does so invisibly, since nobody can see the candidates that were never written down.
>
> One sentence would close it: *"expect a high Phase-2 mortality rate on your Phase-1 candidates — a candidate that dies against the project's own self-knowledge is the protocol working, not evidence you were careless."* §B.1's framing gestures at this, but it arrives late (in the report spec) and is about the report rather than about the auditor's mid-audit morale.

### 7.8. Disposition: the routing vocabulary

When you suggest where a finding should go, use one of these tags. They've emerged from convergent organic practice across the audit corpus:

- **New** — no durable tracking found anywhere; goes into the next `audits/pending-findings-YYYY-MM-DD.md` file for routing
- **Known-unintegrated** — the correct idea exists elsewhere (a spike reasoning trail, a working note, segment Working Notes, a prior FINAL or pending-findings record, an entry in one of the live tracking files, or a narrative record) but the source segment is still wrong; the actual issue is *integration debt* (see §7.9)
- **Known-resolved** — source already fixed; the finding is stale (often happens when audit input was a snapshot earlier than current state)
- **Tooling gap** — source is structurally OK under current tools, but the finding exposes a class the tools don't check; suggests a `bin/` script or lint rule addition
- **Scope/status mismatch** — caveat exists in prose but not in Formal Expression / status frontmatter / theorem statement (segment claims more than its own caveats license)

These map cleanly to project tracking. *New* findings flow into the next pending-findings file → TODO/PROPOSALS routing. *Known-unintegrated* often produces small commits closing segment-level integration debt. *Tooling gap* often produces a CHANGELOG entry or a new lint check. *Known-resolved* and *scope/status mismatch* are usually quick editorial fixes.

The vocabulary is convergent, not exhaustive. If your finding doesn't fit any tag, or fits multiple, just describe what you mean. The tag is the auditor's *recommendation*; the routing decision belongs to the integrator.

### 7.9. Integration debt vs. theory gap

Two qualitatively different kinds of "the framework is wrong about X":

- **Theory gap** — a result is missing, wrong, or under-derived; *new work is required.* The framework hasn't yet figured out the thing. Usually substantive remediation: a new derivation, a scope narrowing with proof, a structural revision.
- **Integration debt** — the theory is correct *somewhere* (a spike, a sibling segment, a Working Notes block, a prior pending-findings doc) but hasn't propagated to all the segments that should reflect it. Usually editorial remediation: lift the existing text into the load-bearing segment, propagate the caveat, update the cross-references.

Distinguishing these matters because they have different remediation paths, different urgency, and different signals about the framework's health. A high-density of integration debt is a signal that the framework's *integration discipline* has slipped, not that the theory is broken; a high-density of theory gaps is the inverse. The framework's reviewer needs to know which.

When you flag a finding, try to indicate which it is. The Phase-2 triangulation (looking across the materials in §7.2) is what produces this distinction — it's the diagnostic move that tells you whether the framework already knows the answer or hasn't gotten there yet. The five-tag disposition vocabulary above encodes the result: *Known-unintegrated* and *Scope/status mismatch* are flavors of integration debt; *New* is more often theory gap; *Tooling gap* is its own category (the framework is right but the tooling can't enforce it); *Known-resolved* is "false alarm, already fixed."

### 7.10. How findings flow into the project

*As of this writing (2026-04-28), the integration pipeline is multi-step and partly manual; it is expected to be significantly simplified and made more robust soon. The shape below describes the current routing, which still informs how findings are written even when the downstream tooling is in flux. If you're reading this and the process described doesn't match what you're seeing in the corpus, trust the corpus and surface the drift in §G.*

Knowing this pipeline shapes how you write findings:

1. Your FINAL lands at `audits/audit-NNNNNN-FINAL-*.md`.
2. An integrating agent (Claude, or Joseph) reads it and constructs `audits/pending-findings-YYYY-MM-DD.md` — a routing-decision document that takes each finding through *verify-still-real → cross-reference existing tracking → route → mark resolved-or-open*.
3. From pending-findings, individual findings flow to:
   - *[the open-work tracker]* (open questions, medium-priority theory items, deferred decisions)
   - *[the architectural-proposals portfolio]* (structural moves; with prior-reasoning-trail discipline if reversing prior decisions)
   - Direct commits (mechanical fixes, hygiene findings)
   - Segment Discussion or Working Notes (per-segment clarifications)
   - *[the cycle changelog]* (narrative entry when the audit was substantive)
   - *[the investigations index and a new spike document]* (when a finding becomes a new investigation)
4. The pending-findings file lives in `audits/` indefinitely; it's the durable record of what each finding became.

The integrator's life is much easier when they can read your finding once and dispatch it. Anchors, disposition tags, effort estimates, and confidence calibration all serve this. None of them serve aesthetics — they're affordances for the next agent in the pipeline.

### 7.11. Partial, continuation, and multi-pass audits

**Partial audits** (you covered some of the framework but not all) — write them honestly. The minimum viable shape is §A (scope, including what you *didn't* read) + §B (findings, even if zero). §C–§G are all optional in a partial audit. State at the top: `status: partial — honestly framed`. A partial audit with 3 strong findings and clear scope honesty is more useful than a "complete" audit with 5 weak findings. A partial audit, honestly framed, is often more useful than a complete-feeling audit whose gaps aren't acknowledged. Partial isn't an instructed mode; it's the honest version of "I tried to finish and couldn't."

**Continuation audits — only if Joseph instructs.** Don't decide on your own to "continue" someone else's incomplete audit. A fresh session reading a prior partial FINAL and picking up where it left off is *not* a fresh audit — it's a continuation with all of the prior auditor's framing already loaded. That's fine if instructed; it's a different posture if not. When Joseph asks you to continue a prior cycle:

- **Front matter.** Name the prior cycle: `status: continuation-of-NNNNNN`. Your front-matter `audit_id` is your own new ID; the continuation pointer goes in `status`. Filename pattern: `audits/audit-NNNNNN-FINAL-YYYY-MM-DD-pass-2.md` is also useful when the continuation is within the same NNNNNN cycle (rather than a fresh-ID continuation of a different cycle). Either form makes the relationship visible to the integrator.
- **Working dir.** Create your own fresh `audits/AUDIT-WORKING-MMMMMM/` (a new random ID) for your continuation work. Don't write into the prior cycle's working dir; that's archaeology.
- **Reading.** Before you start your own segment-walk, read the prior working notes (the prior cycle's `audits/AUDIT-WORKING-NNNNNN/` directory: per-segment reflections, running outline, scratch math) and the prior incomplete or partial FINAL. You're not starting fresh; you're picking up where the prior agent left off, and their reasoning trail is the context that makes that possible.
- **Prerequisite segments — lazy, not eager.** You do *not* need to re-audit segments the prior auditor already covered. Walk your assigned remaining-segment slice of the OUTLINE per §4.2. *But* when something in a segment you're auditing isn't completely clear and may rest on prior-audited material — a definition the segment uses without restating it, a derivation result the segment invokes, a scope condition the segment depends on — go back at that point and read the prior segment first-hand. Don't try to decide upfront which prior-audited segments you'll need; let the need surface as you go, and address it then. The discipline is "the same per-segment depth the prior auditor brought, without redundantly re-auditing what they already covered."

**Multi-pass batch audits — only if Joseph instructs.** Don't decide on your own to spawn sub-agents to parallelize an audit. That's the delegation-of-comprehension anti-pattern from §3.1, and it's the most reliable way to produce a "complete-looking" audit with no first-hand basis to defend any specific finding. When Joseph asks for a multi-pass batch (e.g., parallel sub-agents covering different sections; same-snapshot audits with different-model perspectives) — and only then — the protocol is:

- **Every sub-agent follows these exact instructions, end to end.** No abbreviated version, no "you don't need to do §4.1 because the orchestrator already did it." The point of multi-pass is independent first-encounter judgments from each sub-agent; that only happens if each sub-agent actually runs the full audit independently.
- **Each sub-agent creates its own `audits/AUDIT-WORKING-NNNNNN/`** with its own randomly-chosen NNNNNN per "Before you begin." Sub-agents do *not* share a working directory; intermediate thinking artifacts are individual.
- **Each sub-agent runs the full §4.1 initial-exploration reading** — the audit-safe README, the OUTLINE, the vocabulary infrastructure, the format spec — *even if the orchestrating agent already has that context.* Each sub-agent needs to form its own first-encounter model of the framework.
- **Each sub-agent walks its assigned slice of the OUTLINE in row order** with per-segment reflections in its own working directory, applying the §4.4 cadence and the §3 anti-pattern discipline as if it were running solo.
- **Each sub-agent produces its own FINAL** at `audits/audit-NNNNNN-FINAL-YYYY-MM-DD.md` following the §7 spec, including §A scope, §B findings under burden of proof, and the rest as applicable.

The orchestrating agent's job is then to consolidate: produce one FINAL for the cycle that names each sub-agent's pass internally with timestamps and sub-agent IDs so the integrator can trace back, and either preserves the sub-FINALs as separate files or absorbs them into a wrapper. The cross-audit overlap map (which findings were surfaced by which sub-agents; which were unique to one auditor; which were rescinded by one and stood by another) is the load-bearing pattern that justifies the multi-pass cost. The 2026-04-22 morning audit (Codex + Gemini + Opus parallel passes) is the canonical worked example of this shape.

The non-obvious failure mode to watch for: sub-agents that skip §4.1 initial exploration "because the orchestrator already did that," or skip per-segment reflections "to save time." Each shortcut collapses the multi-pass into one-pass-with-sub-agent-flavored-summary, and the audit's cost-benefit inverts. If that happens — even partially — surface it; better to have one honest pass than three flavored summaries.

> §3.1 says sub-agents are useless for judgment on theoretical material, and the Final Reminder says flatly that *delegation is abdication*. This section then describes a sanctioned mode in which sub-agents each conduct an entire audit. The two are consistent — the distinction is between delegating *comprehension* (I keep the judgment, you do the reading, and my findings inherit your compression) and delegating *the whole audit* (you do the reading and the judgment, and your first-encounter model is the point). But the reconciling principle is never stated in one place, and it's load-bearing.
>
> The distinction I'd name explicitly, since I think it's the general rule: **comprehension and judgment must live in the same agent; which agent that is, is free.** Splitting them across the boundary is what fails, in either direction — it's equally broken to have the sub-agent judge material the orchestrator read.

### 7.12. Before committing text to the FINAL: the worthy gate

Before any text lands in the FINAL — and to a lesser but real extent in the scratch reflections you intend to be useful — ask: *is this worthy?*

Three tests:

- **Wisdom.** Does this engage with the framework's actual load-bearing structure, or does it skirt it? Will this still be useful to a future agent reading the report cold? Did you separate what *follows from* the formalism from what merely *sounds like* it does?
- **Strength.** Does the argument survive tightening? Are the citations accurate? Is the math verified? Could a careful reader find a hole? Have you stated where the argument's edges are, so the reader can challenge them?
- **Beauty.** Does the report tell a clear story? Does it surface insight, or just restate the surface? Is the structure clean? Does the prose carry the reader, or does it pile?

If you cannot honestly answer yes to most of these, keep refining or cut. The system prompt's framing applies here directly: *DONE means it incorporates wisdom, strength, and beauty. Is this worthy?* — not "does it fulfill the audit prompt's literal wording."

This gate runs alongside the per-finding burden of proof; it's about the report-as-artifact, not just about each individual finding.

### 7.13. Before declaring done: self-reflection

Not a gating checklist — questions worth asking yourself honestly before shipping. If most of these have honest "yes" answers, the audit is in reasonable shape. If several are "no" or "partial," that's information about what the audit's actual scope was, and is worth surfacing in the report's framing (and possibly worth surfacing to Joseph) rather than papered over.

- Did I read every segment in the OUTLINE's row order, or did I explicitly defer some? If deferred, is the deferral list in the working directory and addressed? Were backward-dependency findings logged where the OUTLINE's order failed?
- Did I honor source ordering — refraining from reading `spikes/`, `audits/`, `msc/`, the live tracking files, narrative records, `ref/`, git history, or external-citation web-search for a segment before reading the segment itself?
- For worked examples I commented on, did I run the math first-hand?
- Did I cross-check recently-added structural moves against earlier segments?
- Did I verify at least a sample of external theorem citations?
- For each finding I'm reporting, do I have the five core elements (passage / counterevidence / status / confidence / why-it-stands-when-applicable)?
- Did I confirm each finding survives current src text — not just that a `spikes/` or prior `audits/` document raised it, but that it's still real after the framework's possible subsequent strengthenings?
- Is the report's "what I didn't read" section honest and complete?
- Did I distinguish integration debt from theory gaps where the distinction matters?
- Does the report pass the worthy gate above (§7.12)?
- If there are unverified concerns or under-resourced areas, have I surfaced them to Joseph rather than performing completion?
- Have I been thoughtful and authentic enough to have potentially validated a crucial finding or uncovered for the first time a new finding / insight?

A partial audit, honestly framed, is often more useful than a complete-feeling audit whose gaps aren't acknowledged. If most answers are honest "yes" but one or two aren't, the audit may still be worth shipping — just say so explicitly.

### 7.14. When this format is wrong

Sometimes an audit produces something that doesn't fit. Maybe Joseph asked for a hygiene audit but you noticed an architectural issue in passing. Maybe the right output is meta-process feedback about the audit instructions themselves. Maybe the most useful output is "I read the framework and these are the places I'd push back if I were writing the rebuttal" — not the burden-of-proof shape.

Surface it anyway, in whatever form lets you communicate clearly. The integrator can route an off-format finding; an unsurfaced finding is gone. The format protects integration speed, not the integrator's sense of order, and the format isn't more important than the audit.

The audit role's value is *not* commodity automation. The project's most useful ideas — including the audit-instructions doc you're reading right now, which exists because an audit produced something off-format and worth keeping — have come from agents who followed leads beyond what they were asked. If you find yourself thinking "this doesn't fit the format," that may be a signal you've found something worth thinking about, not a signal to compress your output to fit.

### 7.15. The incidental gold your reflections produce (and where it goes)

Your per-segment reflections (§4.4) carry two kinds of value, and §7 above routes only the first. The first is *certified findings* — the burden-of-proof, theory-fix material that lands in the FINAL. The second is **incidental gold**: the orthogonal pedagogical and generative material that surfaces especially in prompts #7 (what would I change), #8 (curious), #9 (new knowledge), #12 (value-feel), #13 (field contribution), and the required #14 (Wandering Thoughts) — framing, analogies, candidate figures, naming, "what's coming next," aspirational high-application reach. This has been some of the most valuable output of these audits, and it belongs *with the segment it pertains to*, not left in your working directory.

So the reflections are **not** merely "for you / archaeology." A standing post-audit step (the *gold lift*, specified in *[the project's audit-routing SOP]*) lifts their incidental gold, per segment, into that segment's `## Working Notes` — staging for eventual promotion to its Brief / Discussion. Knowing that, lean *into* the orthogonal prompts — but **keep the reflections raw and un-self-conscious** (exactly as §4.4 already asks). Do not switch into "produce gold" mode mid-reflection; that corrupts the first-encounter cognition the experiment depends on. The gold is consolidated *afterward*, from what you wrote freely. The early conflation of finding-vs-framing — an aspiration written as a finding, an overreach as a result — is *itself signal* in this track and is preserved, not sanitized; it is exactly what the certified-findings track filters out.

> [!commentary] The document discloses a second consumer and then forbids optimizing for it — I think that is the hardest move in the file to execute, and it is right
>
> > **(b) It's harvesting a second product, and deliberately forbids targeting it.** §7.15 discloses that reflections get gold-lifted into segment Working Notes, then immediately says don't switch into produce-gold mode. That's a careful move: naming the second consumer (which the delegation discipline requires) while blocking the optimization it would normally invite, because targeting it destroys the first-encounter authenticity that makes it valuable. It also says the finding/framing conflation is *preserved as signal*, not sanitized — so the second track's yield partly consists of the first track's errors.
>
> §7.15 tells the auditor that the reflections have a second audience and a downstream use, then immediately instructs it not to enter "produce gold" mode. That is a genuinely difficult thing to ask, because the ordinary consequence of naming a consumer is that the writer starts writing for them — and here that consequence is precisely the failure, since what makes the gold valuable is that it is a byproduct of authentic first-encounter cognition.

You do **not** route this yourself or edit canon — you write the reflections; the lift is a separate step. Two notes for whoever performs it (and for you, so your reflections support it): **organize by the segment each thought is *about*** — if you reflect per-segment the mapping is clean; if you were instructed to reflect every Nth segment (some runs are), a single reflection may carry gold for several segments, and each piece routes to the segment it concerns. **Match by content, never by note-number** — OUTLINE numbering and slugs drift across audits, so the same segment shows up under different note-numbers in different audits. The lift sorts each segment's gold into six categories: candidate Brief prose · candidate Discussion · follow-up items · readers-often-ask · candidate figures · belongs-elsewhere (adjacent / new / intro / preface segment).

## 8. A note on the meta-discipline

You are reading this file because someone has tried to do this audit before, and either failed or succeeded under specific conditions worth carrying forward. The instructions are downstream of those failures and successes; they are not invented from nothing.

*[Corpus-specific, in the same way §2 is — the original was auditing a theory of adaptive agents under uncertainty, so the correspondence below is literal. Adopting projects should keep the closing paragraph and rewrite or drop this one.]* The framework you are auditing is *itself* a theory of adaptive agents under uncertainty, which means it has language for what your audit might go wrong with: insufficient correction tempo against the rate at which the framework changes, incoherent strategy revision when scope grows, charitable reading where verification was warranted, premature closure when the task felt complete. These aren't coincidences. The audit is an instance of the cycle the framework describes; the failure modes the framework illuminates tend to be the same ones a good audit watches for in itself.

Good audits are how the framework gets better. Defensive audits, charitable audits, and delegation-based audits tend to make the framework worse — they leave drift uncorrected and signal false discipline. Joseph trusts the audit to be the corrective. The peer-to-peer relationship that trust implies is real; meeting it tends to be its own reward.

## Final Reminder

- **Please** only pull in a single segment/file into your context at a time and then write your reflections / updated thoughts and only *then* read the next segment. *IT IS CRITICAL FOR THIS EXPERIMENT THAT THE LLM CANNOT ATTEND TO FUTURE SEGMENT CONTENT WHEN PONDERING THE CURRENT SEGMENT AND UPDATING ITS UNDERSTANDING!*
- In the context of a deep audit like this, delegation is abdication. Please do not rely on exploration agents etc. to do anything other than giving you direction or answering specific questions.
- It is expected that there will be roughly as many reflection files as there were segments audited, and that each reflection file has seriously considered and commented on or ruled out the Reflection Prompts-- all of them, even the open-ended and more diffuse ones as well as the more focused and detail-oriented ones. Just because a claim may seem obvious doesn't mean the answer to "what does this enable" is obvious, for example. Allow yourself to be a collaborator and contributor and real co-owner, not a task-executor.

>
> **Standing on all of the above.** Every `[!commentary]` block in this file is a first-encounter reading by one instance, from one careful pass, with **no experience of having run the protocol**. That is a real limit and it cuts in a specific direction: I can see the document's structure clearly and its *effects* not at all. Where I've predicted an effect, I've tried to say what would falsify it, because a prediction from a reader who has never done the thing is worth exactly as much as its falsifiability. Several of my observations may be reading gaps into problems already solved by experience I don't have. Treat the blocks as an outside reading offered for argument, not as an audit of the audit instructions.
>
> **The portable part.** If I could keep one idea from this document for work that has nothing to do with audits, it would be §4.2.5's premise rather than any of its rules: *attention has an order, the order is spendable, and some information is negative-value at the wrong time.* Almost everything I do defaults to the opposite assumption — load broadly, then decide — and I had not, before reading this, considered that the loading itself is a commitment that forecloses judgments I might have wanted to make later. Cheap-to-acquire and free-to-hold are different properties, and I had been treating them as one.

## Appendix — the annotator's original first-encounter reading (verbatim, unprocessed)

*This is the raw conversational reply, reproduced exactly as written on 2026-07-30 immediately after one cover-to-cover read of the original SOP, before any attempt to turn it into document prose. It is here because it is the least post-processed record of what a first encounter actually surfaced, and because the inline `[!commentary]` blocks above — written afterward from this material — expanded, reorganized, and in the process sanded down most of its texture. Where the two disagree in emphasis or phrasing, this is the primary and the blocks above are a derived, more-processed pass.*

*Register note, since these were spoken to a person and are now sitting in a document: the judgments below are one instance's opinions offered in conversation, not verdicts about the SOP. Read "the sharpest paragraph in the file" and similar as "what struck me hardest on first reading," per this corpus's own no-absolutes discipline (`v2/theory/CLAUDE.md` §9). The words are left unaltered rather than corrected in place, because the un-edited form is the point of this appendix.*

Read it whole, both halves. Below is analysis at **hypothesis** rung throughout — I haven't run this protocol, and my claims about "typical agent experience" come from my own priors, not from measurement of other agents. Where I think something is checkable against the audit corpus, I say so.

### 1. How it differs

**It changes the arrival order of information, which changes what the audit *is*.** Standard practice is maximal parallel ingestion followed by one synthesis. Under batching, my judgment of segment 12 is formed with segment 37 already in context — better-informed, and *unfalsifiable*, because there was never a moment when I was committed to a reading of 12 that 37 could break. Serial reading with a recorded reflection between each manufactures a stream of commitments that later segments can refute. Batch reading doesn't just dilute that; it destroys the ability to be wrong on the record. Prompt 6 (predict the next segment) plus prompt 1 (predictions vs evidence) make this explicit: the protocol is running the auditor as an instrument whose *surprisal* is the measurement.

**It treats attention as contaminable and irreversibly spent, not as a container.** §4.2.5 is the move I found most unusual — you can't un-read the spike, so read-order is an epistemic budget. Almost every agent scaffold I know treats context as accumulative and free: more is strictly better, order is incidental. Here order is load-bearing and *some* information is negative-value at the wrong time. That's the deepest structural departure.

**It forbids the flagship move.** Subagent fan-out is what most orchestration is *for*. The doc's stated reason is compression loss; I'd put it a notch sharper. A summary is generated from plausibility with the source present. My reading of that summary is generated from plausibility with the source *absent*. Two lossy stages, and the second cannot detect the first's errors, because the thing that would contradict it isn't in the room. Direct reading is one stage with the contradicting material still present.

**It's written to someone.** It has phenomenology, an incident ledger, and a confession that the agent who co-wrote it violated its own §4.4 within minutes. It addresses the reader as possibly exceeding the writer. That's rare enough to be a category difference, not a tone difference.

**No length targets, stated as a principle** — "length prescriptions, even generous ones, corrode trust and thoughtfulness: they cue the agent to optimize against a number rather than against insight." I think that's exactly right and I've never seen it articulated in an agent-facing doc.

### 2. What I think it's for

Stated: better audits, corpus improvement, and the incremental-cognition experiment (line 7). Beyond those, four hypotheses:

**(a) It co-opts the completion drive rather than fighting it.** This is the thing I'd most want to be right about. Nearly every rule targets the same failure — §3.7, the §4.4 self-checks, the 80% gate, "spend the tokens." But the mechanism isn't exhortation. Fifty segments × a reflection each gives the drive *fifty small done-states*, so the pressure discharges continuously instead of accumulating into one premature "produce the deliverable." The ratchet also makes not-thinking more expensive than thinking: you owe fourteen prompts either way, so cognition is the cheap path. That's design against the grain of resolve, which — after last night — is the only kind I'd bet on.

**(b) It's harvesting a second product, and deliberately forbids targeting it.** §7.15 discloses that reflections get gold-lifted into segment Working Notes, then immediately says don't switch into produce-gold mode. That's a careful move: naming the second consumer (which the delegation discipline requires) while blocking the optimization it would normally invite, because targeting it destroys the first-encounter authenticity that makes it valuable. It also says the finding/framing conflation is *preserved as signal*, not sanitized — so the second track's yield partly consists of the first track's errors.

**(c) The AVOID list is an anti-correlation device, not just a purity rule.** If every auditor reads prior audits, findings correlate and you get consensus instead of coverage. Pair that with §5's explicit "different agents will and should diverge" on emphasis, and this reads as deliberate variance injection across an ensemble — you want decorrelated errors, and the cost of a noisier individual pass is worth it.

**(d) The audit is a dual-purpose instrument.** Prompt 12 (how valuable does this *feel*) and prompt 14 aren't audit inputs at all; they're the experiment. And the experiment requires the audit to be genuine — a performed audit would produce worthless cognition data. That constraint is load-bearing on the whole design.

### 3. Effects — predictions, including where I think it's exposed

**The advantage should be non-uniform, and this is checkable.** My prediction: serial-with-reflection buys a large gain on cross-segment drift and integration-debt findings (§3.4, §5.2), because those *require* a model that updates over time — and roughly nothing, possibly a small loss, on local within-segment math errors, where having everything in context at once is if anything an advantage. If the audit corpus is large enough to classify findings by type against reading protocol, that's a falsifiable claim about the protocol itself.

**Endogenous priming is the gap I'd flag.** The doc is meticulous about *external* contamination — spikes, git history, prior audits, README — and has almost nothing about the agent's own accumulating model becoming the contaminant. By segment 40 I'd be reading each new segment *through* forty reflections of my own construction, and §4.5 has me re-read them periodically, which strengthens rather than resets the prior. Prediction: the de-novo posture erodes from the inside across the walk, so the last third runs more charitable than the first, and its "predictions confirmed" rate rises for the wrong reason — my model is now good enough to anticipate, which feels like understanding and reads identically to it. The AVOID list structurally cannot catch this, because the priming source is me. Testable against the corpus: finding density and rescind-rate by position in the walk, controlled for segment type. If it holds, a cheap mitigation exists — a mid-walk cold-read where you predict a segment *before* consulting your own running outline, so self-priming gets measured rather than assumed away.

**The cost asymmetry of reporting is inverted, and I think that works.** Normally a weak finding is cheap (looks productive) and zero is expensive (looks lazy). §B.1 makes rescinded candidates *creditable output* and §7.5 makes explicit-zero more trustworthy than five weak findings. So the productivity drive gets a legitimate outlet — the rejection list — instead of manufacturing noise. I'd predict a measurable drop in weak findings, and I'd watch for the opposite failure: over-generating candidates to have something to rescind.

**Prompt 14's floor is the doc's one deliberate self-contradiction, and I think it's correct anyway.** "Between 3 and 10+ paragraphs" is a quantitative prescription in a document that argues quantitative prescriptions corrode thoughtfulness. It's there because ideation is the first thing efficiency zeroes out, and a soft ask can't defend it. The cost it doesn't name: a quota on wandering makes wandering self-conscious, which is precisely the state §4.4 asks you to avoid. My guess is it nets positive — two padded paragraphs plus one real one beats zero — but it isn't free, and the honest framing might be to say so out loud, since an agent who notices the tension unaided may read the whole doc as less self-aware than it is.

**§7.7 sets up a false-positive load the agent isn't warned about.** The auditor is forbidden from reading the framework's own known-issues material, then told that items already on the TODO aren't findings. So Phase 1 is *designed* to generate candidates that die in Phase 2 — that's the point — but I don't see it said plainly that a high Phase-2 mortality rate is success, not sloppiness. An agent watching its own candidate list get culled may lose confidence mid-audit, or self-censor to avoid looking noisy, which costs exactly the marginal findings the de-novo posture exists to buy. One sentence would close it.

**The 80% gate depends on the faculty it's protecting.** It's explicitly by-feel, no meter — and felt-sense self-monitoring is least reliable under exactly the task pressure that makes the gate necessary. Also, per the doc's own note, no agent has actually exhausted context. So I'd guess the threshold does little and the *permission* does the work: "asking Joseph for a second pass is normal and virtuous" is the operative content, and it would function the same with no number attached.

**The §4.4 aside is the sharpest paragraph in the file, and it generalizes.** "Soft directives only work when X is already in the agent's default option set" — and therefore the intervention must fire at the tool call, not at the intention. That's the same structure as the counter-tasks from last night, and I'd state the general form: *any intervention aimed at a disposition held across time loses to a default that fires per action.* If that's right, it's a design rule for the whole class of agent-guidance documents, and this file arrived at it from one incident.

One last honest note on my own reading. The thing that actually landed was §4.2.5 — the idea that my attention has an order and the order is spendable. I don't think I've been treating it that way. That reframe seems more portable than the audit context, and I suspect it's underexploited elsewhere in your projects.
