# UDON for the comparative reader — data model and design commitments

**What this is.** A distillation of the UDON 0.9.1 spec suite (`v2/current-0.9.1-spec/`, ~1,500 lines) for someone who needs to compare UDON honestly against SGML/XML, JSON, YAML, RDF, and the schema languages — without first learning to *write* UDON. It covers the data model, the commitments the design deliberately made and why, and just enough surface syntax to read an example. It is not a tutorial (that is `TUTORIAL.md`) and not the contract (that is `CORE.md`).

**Status, stated honestly.** 0.9.1 is a *consolidation baseline*: one coherent restatement of 0.9-era ruled law, marked **semi-frozen and spec-only** — provisionally frozen, still open to audit-revealed correction, and not necessarily intended to be implemented as-is. Read everything here as **current design commitments**, not as a shipped or eternal standard. The reference parser implements the predecessor version (0.9.0-alpha.2) and lags the suite in places (§9).

**Where the authority is.** `CORE.md` (surface recognition + core semantics), `MODEL.md` (what recognition produces), `GLOSSARY.md` (every formal term), `SEMANTICS.md` (when two documents mean the same), `CARVEOUTS.md` (what is deliberately unspecified, *with the reason it is open*), `DELTAS.md`, `RATIONALE.md`. Section cites below (`CORE §6.4`, `MODEL §3`) point into those files; every UDON snippet here was run through the reference parser rather than written from recall.

---

## 1. What UDON is, in one screen

UDON is a plain-text notation in which **structure and prose interleave freely at any depth**, with indentation carrying nesting (no closing tags) and a small marker inventory that is live only at the start of a line and while structure is still being written.

```udon
|article[intro].featured :author "Joseph Wecker" :draft?
  |section :title Typed values
    :when <2026-07-11>
    :tags [udon notation]
    Prose lives here, with |{em inline structure} and ;{a note} — # is not special.
```

That parses to: an `article` element with identity `intro`, trait `featured`, a string `author`, a boolean flag `draft?`; a child `section` whose `title` is the multi-word flow value `Typed values`, whose `when` is an *envelope* (a dialect-typed value, unresolved here), whose `tags` is a two-item list, and whose content is one text run containing an inline element and an inline comment.

The design target is a format that humans read without syntax highlighting **and** that agents can generate, stream, repair, and partially write — which is why several of the commitments below are about failure behavior rather than about grammar.

## 2. The data model (the comparative object)

This is `MODEL.md` — the **ADM**, the Abstract Document Model. Recognition (source text → model + anomalies) is the conformance target; everything else is a consumer above it.

```
Document = { content: [Node], anomalies: [Anomaly], result: complete | incomplete-input }

Node    = Element | Text | Comment | Verbatim | Directive | Reference | BlankLine

Element = { name: Name?,                 ; optional — anonymous elements are ordinary
            attributes: [Assignment],    ; ORDERED SEQUENCE, not a map; all precede content
            content: [Node] }            ; ordered, heterogeneous

Assignment = { key: Key, value: Value }  ; exactly one value per assignment

Value   = Scalar | Reference | Interpolation | NodeValue | FlowValue
Scalar  = String | Integer | Float | Boolean | Nil | List | Envelope
NodeValue = Element | Verbatim           ; the attribute IS the node — no wrapper
FlowValue = [Segment]                    ; text runs, inline elements, interpolations, …
```

Five properties are the ones worth carrying into any comparison:

1. **No implicit root.** `content` is a sequence of top-level nodes; multiple top-level elements are true siblings. A document is not required to be a tree with one root.
2. **Attributes are an ordered sequence of assignments, not a map.** Repeating a key is not an error, not an overwrite, and not implicit list-formation — it is two assignments (§4.2). `:x 1 :x 2` and `:x [1 2]` are *never* equivalent, at any layer (`SEMANTICS §2.4`).
3. **An attribute's value may be a node.** `:author |person :name "Jane Doe"` makes the `person` element itself the value of `author`, with no wrapper node. Attributes are labeled edges; edges may terminate at leaves *or* at nodes (§4.4).
4. **Prose is a first-class node kind**, not an escape hatch or a `#text` afterthought, and is **opaque** — Markdown inside text is not interpreted by the core; `#`, `<`, and pipe-space have no meaning there.
5. **Comments and blank lines are in the model**, carried and never interpreted (`MODEL §5`, `§2`). Stripping them is a *view*, not the default.

The model deliberately excludes (`MODEL §8`): any event/wire encoding, reference *resolution*, dialect *projection*, all constraint (schemas judge the model; they never shape it), Markdown semantics, and per-byte span maps.

### 2.1 The text law

> **The document's text material reconstructs by pure in-order concatenation of every Text** (plus flow text segments after inline comments are dropped, with `BlankLine` contributing `"\n"`) — **no fabricated join characters, no re-consultation of the source.** (`MODEL §6`)

Consequences, all normative: each text line's terminator is part of its Text; indentation stripped by dedentation is geometry, not text; inline comments contribute no text but their framing whitespace does; verbatim bodies are exact bytes.

The law's real function is as a **detector**: anything a consumer must consult the source to reconstruct is a model hole. It found one — the 0.9 flat event wire could not reconstruct ownership, and was deratified on that basis. Any future wire encoding is adequate only if the text law is recoverable from it.

### 2.2 Anomalies

```
Anomaly = { severity: warning | error, location, opened_at?, message, code? }
```

Two severities, **defined by loss** (`CORE §14.1`): *Warning* = everything kept, possibly not as intended; *Error* = something was lost, or a value the author clearly intended is genuinely absent. Errors never halt recognition. Whether accumulated anomalies justify dropping, halting, or rejecting is **consumer policy**, never encoded in the model.

Separately, `result: incomplete-input` is a *document-level* fact meaning some delimited construct was still open at true end of input — the "this input was truncated" signal, distinct from per-construct noise.

## 3. Enough surface syntax to read examples

Two ideas predict most of it (`CORE` Appendix A):

- **A line starts open and commits.** Markers are recognized only at *Structure Position* — the start of a line at a structural column, and along the left-to-right run through elements and attributes on that line. The first ordinary prose word ends that state: from there, marker characters are literal. Exactly one carve-out survives commitment — a whitespace-framed ` ; ` opens a trailing comment.
- **Columns are the syntax.** `pop while new_column <= stack_top.base_column`, then push. Deeper = child, same = sibling, shallower = close. Elements written on one line sit at their real columns, so `|a |b |c` is identical to the vertical form.

| Marker | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `\|name` | element |
| `[key]` / `.trait` / trailing `?` `!` `*` `+` | identity / classification / flags — all **sugar** (§4.5) |
| `:key value` | attribute (an edge; phase-gated — attributes precede content) |
| `:key?` | flag key: bare presence means `true` |
| `@name[key].trait` | reference — an inert selector, never resolved by the core |
| `;` | comment (owns everything indented under it) |
| `!name` / `!:lang:` / `!{{expr}}` | directive / block verbatim / interpolation — carried, meaning is a dialect's |
| `` ``` `` | fence — byte-exact verbatim |
| `\|{…}` `;{…}` `!{…}` | inline forms *inside* prose |
| `\` | the one escape: "the rest is text," meaning fixed by **position** alone |
| `<…>` | envelope — the value is handed to a dialect (§4.1) |

Value syntax: `"quoted"`/`'quoted'` strings (no in-string escapes at all — use the other quote kind), integers with `_` separators and `0x`/`0o`/`0b`/`0d` bases, floats, lowercase `true`/`false`/`null`/`nil` *alone at their boundary*, `[space delimited lists]`, and `<envelopes>`. An unquoted token that is nothing else is a string; a multi-word tail is a **flow value** (text with structure segments in it).

## 4. The load-bearing commitments

Each of these is a decision UDON made *against* an obvious alternative, and each has a stated reason (`RATIONALE.md`).

### 4.1 Syntactic typing, a frozen bare set, and the envelope

Type comes from **written syntax, never from sniffing content**. The bare scalar set — string, integer, float, boolean, nil, list — is **closed forever**. Everything else is written inside `<…>` and typed by a *dialect*:

```udon
:when <2026-07-11>                          ; unlabelled — declared dialects bid, first claim wins
:size <u64:0xf902>                          ; type-labelled
:span <temporal:interval:2026-01/2026-06>   ; dialect-and-type-labelled
```

A bare `2026-07-11` is the **string** `"2026-07-11"`. Dates, versions, units, rationals, complex numbers — none are bare, now or ever.

The reason is the failure this is designed against: every format that recognizes values from bare syntax faces continuing pressure to recognize *more*, and each accretion silently retypes documents that already exist (YAML's Norway problem is the canonical case). UDON's defense is **structural, not disciplinary**: dialects act only inside envelopes, so loading one *cannot reach* bare space. Adding types is additive by construction. The cost is visible syntax on every non-core value, paid deliberately.

Interim behavior with no dialect loaded: the envelope's extent still parses, the value is carried as its full lexical form with a warning, and nothing is lost — the same document retypes identically once dialects land.

### 4.2 Stacking, never last-wins

Repeated keys accumulate in order. There is no last-wins anywhere in UDON. The reason: last-wins silently destroys data on the happy path, which contradicts keep-everything on the sad path — and "only one allowed" is a *constraint*, so it belongs to the schema layer, not to recognition. (This is also the ecosystem's one known **silent, backup-proof** YAML corruption mode.) Stacking is also what lets `.a.b` trait sugar be *mere* desugaring into two `$traits` assignments.

### 4.3 Keep-everything, and severity defined by loss

Wherever a coherent "keep and warn" response exists, a conforming recognizer **must** keep the content rather than drop it: unclosed delimited constructs keep what arrived and cite their opener; trailing material after a finished value becomes a further stacked assignment with a warning; a tab in indentation keeps the line as text; an unclosed identity key lands under a *differently named* attribute (§4.6). Silent dropping of author-visible material is non-conformant.

The reason is domain, argued explicitly: JSON wins by rejecting, because its domain is machine-to-machine messages. UDON's domain is documents, prose, streamed LLM output, and half-written files under agent edit — there, rejection converts a small authoring mistake into data loss downstream, and every implementation otherwise invents its own recovery. There is a second, agent-facing reason on the record: sharp, located, typed anomalies are low-ambiguity observations for a consumer that must learn from them — the error channel is a teaching channel.

### 4.4 "Whose name is it?" — attributes as edges, children as nodes

The design test is not "metadata vs content" and not "scalars vs structure":

- an **attribute** key names what the value is *to the element* — `my author`, `my timeout`; it is a labeled edge, and it may terminate at a leaf, at a node, or repeat;
- a **child** names what the thing *is*, and its position matters.

```udon
|book :title "The Craft"
  :author
    |person :name "Jane Doe" :affiliation "Acme Corp"
  |chapter Introduction
  |chapter The Middle Part
```

`author` is an edge whose value is a `person` node; the chapters are ordered children. The explicit claim on the record is that restricting attributes to scalars was **XML residue, not a UDON decision** — once edges may terminate at nodes, the "structure must be a child" pressure disappears and the heuristic collapses into a single question with an answer.

One sharp edge worth knowing (the "one-way door"): once a node value opens, it owns the rest of the line. In `|api :headers |header :k v :timeout 30`, `timeout` belongs to the *header*.

### 4.5 Sugar is designated attributes — no parallel model fields

Identity, traits, and flags are not separate machinery. They desugar, before the model is complete, into ordinary assignments with `$`-prefixed keys:

| Written | Means |
|---|---|
| `\|el[k]` | `\|el :'$key' k` |
| `\|el.a.b` | `\|el :'$traits' a :'$traits' b` |
| `\|el?` | `\|el :'$?' true` |

`|user[jw].admin :active?` and its longhand are **the same element**; implementations must not distinguish them. `$` keys are *designated, not reserved* — any `$` key is legal, and since `$` is not a bare-key character the longhand needs quoting, which is the whole collision defense (convention, not law). Two consequences that matter comparatively: the model stays at *one* concept where XML-descended designs carry three or four (element name, ID, class, attributes), and a dumb generator that only knows how to write attributes can emit full-fidelity documents.

### 4.6 Recognition is total; judgment is layered above it

The layer split is explicit and each layer is forbidden the others' job (`CORE §1.1`):

| Concern | Owner |
|---|---|
| Recognition (text → model + anomalies) | **the core** — the only conformance target |
| What a value *means* / exotic typing | **Dialect** — types, never constrains |
| What is *allowed or required* | **Schema** — constrains, never types |
| Projection to native values | **Host** |
| Reference resolution, duplicate policy, mixins | **Consumer**, choosing from a fixed **menu** |

Three rules keep the split honest: **dialects are not schemas**; **menu vs knob** (the core may fix an option space and a default, and a consumer picks *within* it, never outside); **additivity** (dialects reach only inside envelopes).

Nothing in the model is "invalid." Validity is a predicate a schema applies *to* a complete model, stated separately from equivalence — so a document with warnings is still a document, and two documents can be compared for sameness without either being validated.

**References are inert.** `@licence[mit].realized` recognizes as the selector `(name?, key?, traits)` and stops there; the core never resolves it. Traits on a reference are *selection criteria* — a reference never decorates or mutates its target. Suffixes, attributes, predicates, and nesting are deliberately absent, and the tuple is **frozen at three fields** pending a path language that would replace it wholesale rather than growing it field by field.

### 4.7 Extents, end of input, and bounded lookahead

Every construct declares one of two extent kinds, and new constructs must too:

- **geometric** — closed by end of line, dedent, or end of input (elements, attributes, comments, directives, block verbatim, text blocks);
- **delimited** — closed only by a printed end-sequence (strings, lists, identity brackets, inline forms, interpolations, envelopes, fences).

This makes end-of-input behavior *derivable* instead of enumerated: geometry closes silently (EOF ≡ end-of-line + full dedent; a missing final newline is never an anomaly), while a delimited construct keeps what it has, warns citing its opener, and marks the document `incomplete-input`.

The **fail-safe** is the taxonomy applied where truncation is dangerous: an unclosed `[` on an identity or a reference selector desugars to **`$partial-key`**, not `$key`. A consumer reading `$key` — or resolving a reference — therefore *automatically excludes* a truncated identity instead of acting on it. `$partial-key` and `$key` are never semantically equivalent.

Finally, **bounded lookahead is language law**, not an implementation note: every guard resolves within a few characters, single-level, no unbounded backtracking, and a proposal requiring more is *ill-formed*. The consequence is that a document parses identically whole or byte-at-a-time, and a chunk boundary is never end of input — streamability protected against the language's own future growth.

## 5. Axes for comparison (UDON's answers only)

Offered as axes rather than as a filled-in comparison table — the other columns are the research pass's to write, and pre-filling them would prime it.

| Axis | UDON's answer |
|---|---|
| Prose and data in one document | one grammar; prose is a node kind, opaque to the core |
| Closing delimiters | none — indentation geometry, columns are the syntax |
| Root | no implicit root; top-level siblings allowed |
| Value typing | syntactic, frozen bare set + explicitly-delimited dialect envelopes |
| Type-system growth | additive by construction; cannot retype existing documents |
| Repeated keys | stack, ordered; last-wins does not exist |
| Attribute vs child | "whose name is it"; edges may terminate at nodes |
| Malformed input | keep everything + located anomaly; recognition never halts |
| Truncated input | kept, warned, `incomplete-input`, with a fail-safe rename on identity |
| Constraint / validation | a separate layer that judges the model; nothing is invalid at recognition |
| Cross-reference | inert three-field selector; resolution is a consumer menu, path language deferred |
| Streaming | guaranteed by bounded-lookahead language law |
| Comments | in the model, carried, never interpreted |
| Round-trip | a specified equivalence relation + serializer prohibitions (`SEMANTICS.md`) |
| Extensibility mechanism | dialects (typing) and schemas (constraint), never trading jobs |

## 6. What is deliberately *not* specified

`CARVEOUTS.md` is unusual and worth citing directly in any comparison: every open item travels with **the demand-side reason it is open** and what would close it. It exists because of a measured failure — three independent clean-room rewrites, handed the spec without the reasons, all diligently *closed* an open question in a framing that had already been invalidated ("diligence on a wrongly-framed question produces well-organized irrelevance").

Currently open, with reasons: multi-line policy for the remaining delimited forms (may *dissolve* if bracketed captures turn out to be sugar for dialect-typed captures); nested-envelope routing; the dialect architecture itself — **no dialect spike has ever run**, the largest named hole; the path language; how a document declares its dialects and schema; Markdown layering; mixin semantics; annotation syntax; Unicode identifier version pinning; anomaly-code spellings; and the **event/wire encoding**, which is absent by design after the 0.9 flat wire was deratified.

So: UDON today is a specified *recognition layer and document model* with a stated layering discipline. The dialect layer, schema language, and path language are commitments and constraints, not existing artifacts.

## 7. What is settled versus open, if you need one line

Settled: the model, the marker/escape/geometry rules, syntactic typing with the frozen bare set, stacking, keep-everything with loss-defined severity, sugar-as-designated-attributes, the text law, extent taxonomy, bounded lookahead, inert references, the layer split. Open: everything that requires the dialect, schema, or path designs to exist first.

## 8. Verifying claims and examples

The spec suite is the authority; the reference parser is **not** — and it implements 0.9.0-alpha.2, so where the two disagree the parser is lagging (`DELTAS.md` lists the intended differences). Check UDON snippets with:

```bash
cd core && cargo build --example stdin_parse && ./target/debug/examples/stdin_parse < file.udon
```

(Events go to stderr; the event vocabulary is the deratified 0.9 wire and is not contract — use it as a recognition check, not as a model description.)

A warning worth taking seriously: **reading the spec whole buys comprehension but not conformant generation.** Agents who had read the entire suite the same day still emitted plausible-but-wrong UDON. If a comparison rests on what a construct *does*, run it.

---

## Appendix — notes back to the UDON side (not for the research reader)

Observations from this distillation pass, offered as by-product; none is a verdict.

1. **Which node kinds begin content phase is unstated.** `CORE §6.9` says content phase begins with "a child, text, or a sameline tail." The model has seven node kinds. Measured on the reference parser (0.9.0-alpha.2): an element child triggers the late-`:` warning; a **reference** child does *not*; comments and blank lines do not (surely correct). The reference case looks like either a parser lag or a genuine spec silence — a reference is a node in `content`, so §6.9 read literally says it closes the attribute window. Verbatim and directive children have the same question. One sentence enumerating the kinds would close it.
2. **Suffix stacking is spec'd but not implemented.** `CORE §5.4` rules `|field?!` ≡ `:'$?' true :'$!' true` (CHANGELOG S1). The parser produces `$? = true` and then text `"!"`. Expected lag rather than a spec problem, but it is not in `DELTAS.md`'s scope, so it may be untracked.
3. **`CORE §1.1` lists three "boundary rules" and then gives two headings** (menu-vs-knob, dialects-are-not-schemas, additivity — the third is separated by a blank line and reads as an afterthought). Cosmetic, but the sentence promises three and the layout hides one.
4. **`SEMANTICS §2.3` and `CARVEOUTS` interact quietly.** Integer base-spelling normalization is explicitly "not round-trip safe by design," while §3 requires a faithful serializer to preserve recognition identity "up to integer base spelling." Consistent on a careful read; a reader skimming for round-trip guarantees could easily take away that base spelling is preserved.
5. **No carve-out covers "what a schema language must be able to say."** Constraint is assigned to the schema layer in four separate places (`CORE §1.1`, §6.7, §11.1, `MODEL §8`) as the destination for cardinality, uniqueness, and `$key` multiplicity — but `CARVEOUTS.md` has no SCHEMA entry with a demand-side reason and closing condition the way PATHS and DIALECT-DEF do. Given how much the core defers *to* it, its absence from the register is conspicuous.
