# Tools are an agent's observation infrastructure — and their quality is existential

**Claim.** A tool's outputs are observations; the *ambiguity* of those observations is the one designer-controllable knob in a theorem-grade law bounding how much an agent's goals can distort its beliefs. Channel quality gates adaptation speed regardless of loop speed; below a threshold set by the environment's drift rate, the agent doesn't work inefficiently — it fails to persist. "Tool-interface quality" is therefore an existential quantity, not a throughput or ergonomics quantity.

**What each leg carries** (this chapter makes several load-bearing claims at different strengths; the support behind each, at a glance):

| Claim | Support-kind | Strength | What would move it |
|---|---|---|---|
| Bias is bounded by κ×A; A is the one designer knob | theoretic (transmitted, [[scope-channel-collapse| #asf/llm/scope-channel-collapse]]) | conditional (its premises) | check the premises hold for real tool loops; or re-check our carriage against the source |
| Tempo gates adaptation; a bad channel can't be out-iterated | theoretic (transmitted) | conditional | as above |
| Persistence needs tempo above the environment's drift | theoretic (transmitted) | conditional | as above; plus whether "drift" is meaningful for a given task environment |
| Every tool call is a do() intervention; the upgrade is gated on known action-mechanism | theoretic (transmitted) | conditional | as above |
| The ecosystem's "prefer dedicated tool over shell" tables are A-reduction in the wild | observational | robust-qualitative | descent-correct the seven sources; find a harness that prefers raw shell and thrives |
| The 2025 design principles lay down the same rules years earlier | design | robust-qualitative (shares the theory's author — coherence, not corroboration) | an independent designer arriving at the same rules would convert this into a second failure mode |
| The ambiguity estimator has apparently never been run on a real format | observational | heuristic (an absence, at this report's search depth) | run it — which is the chapter's proposed experiment |

## The evidence

**From the formal theory (conditional theorems; [[theory-of-agentic-tooling| the theory report]] reproduces the theory survey whole, with each result's premises):**

- **The κ×A bias law** — belief bias in a coupled (LLM) agent is bounded by (architectural coupling κ) × (observation ambiguity A). Plainly: κ measures how much the agent's *goals* are wired into how it processes what it sees (for an LLM, one forward pass does both, so κ ≈ 1 by construction and cannot be engineered away); A measures how much of an observation's meaning is left open to interpretation the agent's goals could bend. The product bounds how wrong wanting-something can make the agent's beliefs. Since κ is immovable, **A — a property of observation design — is the one knob anyone gets.** (One apparent second lever deserves naming precisely, because it does *not* dislodge that conclusion: the theory offers "wrapping" constructions — routing the agent's belief-updates through goal-blind query channels, or parsing its response into typed belief-vs-strategy fields — that make a coupled model *behave* like a separated one. But these do not lower κ; they leave the forward pass exactly as coupled and instead buy a *certificate* — a provable bound on how much goal-content leaked across a call boundary. The theory is blunt that the certificate is the whole purchase: the actual behavioral leakage it prevents is marginal ("a proof, not a meaningful behavioral delta"), and the weaker of the two regimes — the typed-response one, which is what real structured-output stacks already do — bounds leakage only by the model's instruction-following, behaviorally, not structurally. So wrapping is a verification instrument, not a rival to A: it lets you *prove* separation you mostly already had, while A is what actually moves the bias. Reducing observation ambiguity remains the one knob that changes the agent's beliefs rather than merely certifying them.) The theory's own lever statement: the practical move is "not reducing κ … but reducing A: more tests, more precise metrics, more structured outputs, less reliance on interpretive judgments." Canonical A≈0 observations: a test passing or failing, a compiler error with a specific message, a file's existence. Motivated reasoning is formalized as the high-κ×high-A corner — ambiguity in an agent-facing format is the opening through which goal-conditioned distortion enters, not mere friction.
- **Tempo gating** — an agent's adaptation tempo is loop speed times update quality, summed over its channels (the theory writes it T = Σ ν·η*), and the update-quality term collapses under observation noise: *you cannot outrun a bad observation channel by iterating faster.* Worse, bad channels *hide miscomprehension* (high noise + spuriously-low model uncertainty drives the update gain toward zero: the agent stops updating even when wrong). And correlated channels overcount: more telemetry ≠ more adaptation; only structurally independent channels sum.
- **Persistence threshold** — tempo must exceed the environment's drift rate, scaled by how much mismatch the agent can survive (the theory's T > ρ/‖δ_critical‖). Round-trips-per-orient-step set loop tempo; a tool loop too slow for the environment's drift rate is a viability failure, not a performance failure. And persistence is priced: it demands a *sustained* information intake rate — "survival is not a state you achieve once; it is a sustained burn rate" — so observation channels must supply real capacity or persistence fails regardless of how good the correction logic is. The diagnostic gift of the same chapter: **confident wrongness is a structural-failure signature, not a tuning failure** — persistent mismatch with *systematic structure* in the residuals means the model is the wrong kind of object, and no amount of tuning (or telemetry volume) helps.
- **The interventional gate** — every tool call is a do() intervention in Pearl's sense: the agent *sets* something in the world rather than passively observing it, which is what makes tool-loop data causal (Level-2, "what happens if I do X") rather than merely correlational (Level-1, "what tends to co-occur"). A chat window is Level-1; a bash terminal is Level-2. But the upgrade is *earned*, gated on the loop knowing the tool's action-mechanism — the map from "I called this" to "that happened" (the theory's condition C3) — which is an *interface property*, established by precise action semantics and law-teaching refusals (the [[errors-that-teach| next chapter's]] subject).

**From shipping practice (the same physics instantiated, mostly without the theory):** the ecosystem's converged "prefer dedicated tool over shell equivalent" tables (7 sources, near-verbatim: Read not cat, Edit not sed — "keeps raw stdout out of the conversation") are A-reduction in the wild; the entire context-management machinery ([[context-economy| a later chapter]]) is the description-length budget handled empirically.

**From the first-principles design work:** a 2025 statement of design principles for agent-facing interfaces lays down the same rules as ideology, years before the theory formalized them — "tool loop = epistemic organ (deterministic, honest readout)"; "drive observation ambiguity toward zero (codes, counts, paths — not interpretive prose in the result channel)." This is the report's strongest foundations-level agreement — noted honestly: the design principles and the theory share an author, so the load-bearing independence is between **the theory and the shipped ecosystem**, which arrived at the same rules separately; the design work is the same mind saying it earlier. (No external study directly tests the bias law itself; published evidence corroborates neighboring claims, not this one.)

## What it generates

- **For UDON:** a notation whose parse/validation outcomes are sharp (binary, typed, located) is a bias-reduction instrument *in a formal sense* — the self-describing pitch for schemas turning "does this look right?" into pass/fail. Structural validation is a new near-zero-noise, near-zero-cost channel added to the agent's Level-2 portfolio at the cheapest tier.
- **For the harness:** channel *independence* matters as much as channel count (tests + typecheck + runtime probe genuinely add tempo; three views of one state don't); and there is a runnable eval here — the theory's own operational estimator for ambiguity (probe the same observation under multiple goal-primings, measure interpretation divergence) has apparently never been run on a real format. A candidate experiment for either consumer.

## Honest edges

The theory results are conditional (their named sub-scopes travel with them); the persistence framing transfers to real harnesses only insofar as "drift" is meaningful for the task environment. Nothing here says structure is sufficient — see the [[counter-register| counter-evidence chapter]] — structured modes change the error profile rather than removing it.
