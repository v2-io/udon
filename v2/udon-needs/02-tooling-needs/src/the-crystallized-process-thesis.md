# "Most friction is missing crystallized process, not missing intelligence"

**Claim.** The oldest and most load-bearing thesis in this body of design work, stated in 2025 and never displaced since: a tool is **crystallized process** — hard-won practice encoded so it no longer needs conscious recall — and most of what goes wrong in agent work is not a shortfall of intelligence but the absence of that crystallization. The quantified form is a **60/30/6/4 distribution**: in any real task, roughly 60% of the work is deterministic logic that should be pure code, 30% wants light intelligence (parsing, classification — a small model's job), 6% wants real reasoning, and 4% is genuinely judgment-critical. Tools exist to absorb the 60+30 so the mind in the loop spends itself on the 10 that needs it.

## The evidence

- **The founding statement** (reproduced whole as [[quick-tooling-conventions| the quick-tooling conventions]]): the 2025 tooling conventions lay out the evolution a practice goes through — *conscious practice → deliberate habit → crystallized tool → transparent extension* — and draw the design consequences: a Unix philosophy adapted for *embedded wisdom* ("do one thing well — but embed the wisdom to do it correctly"), predict failure before execution, idempotency by design, silence unless teaching or protecting, and a worthiness gate on every tool. The most striking *empirical* leg is self-administered: in October 2025 the agent doing a citation-repair session audited its own fifteen edits against the distribution and found the ratio inverted — "I spent 90% of my time on mechanical work that should have been crystallized into tools, leaving only 10% for actual reasoning." The thesis, measured against its own author's lived session — and the origin of the demand that tools accept the caller's *intent*, not just parameters (the [[intent-as-parameter| intent chapter]] takes that up).
- **The behavioral mechanism** (reproduced as  
  [[the-pattern| the pattern statement]]): a second body of design work supplies *how* crystallization changes behavior, in two layers — *constraint* (make invalid states inexpressible where appropriate) and *gradient* (make the correct operation the easiest one, with visible-friction escape hatches). Its sharpest line: "Not 'make incorrect things impossible' (too rigid) but 'make correct things so easy that incorrect things feel like friction.'" And its sharpest distinction: a domain-specific *language* makes the domain expressible; a domain-specific *framework* makes the correct domain operations the golden path.
- **The shipping ecosystem echoes the distribution without citing it.** Look at any mature coding harness through the 60/30/6/4 lens: deterministic edit-matching ladders and mandatory-read gates are the 60; small-model layers that skim and prune tool output are the 30; the main model's reasoning is the 6; escalation to the human is the 4. (This is our structural reading, not the harnesses' own account.) The gradient's failure mode also exists in first person: one agent's post-mortem records that chaining unverified edits "was the easiest path" — and broke the system three times. When the gradient points the wrong way, agents slide down it.
- **The theory prices it.** The persistence economics of the [[tools-are-observation-infrastructure| observation-infrastructure chapter]] give crystallization a formal return: an investment of time pays when it is less than (expected future uses) × (comprehension time saved per use) × (number of distinct future readers) — and under agent workloads that last factor is large, because every future session is a fresh reader. The [[errors-that-teach| refusal chapter]]'s "well-taught laws become infinite-velocity components of the agent's environment model" is the same thesis at the scale of a single interaction.

## What it generates

- **For the harness:** the distribution is an *architecture prior* — before reaching for a bigger model, ask which fraction of the failing work is 60-shaped, and crystallize that (a validator, a gate, a template). The harness programme's own catalog of corrected agent behaviors independently arrived at the routing this implies: some expectations are better encoded as harness guardrails than as prompt lines. Crystallized process *is* that routing, named a year earlier.
- **For UDON:** notation is crystallization's substrate. A schema is crystallized validation; a house style is crystallized formatting judgment; an edit tool that owns indentation geometry (the [[schema-guarded-mutation| guarded-mutation chapter]]) is crystallized indent discipline. The ease gradient is the standing design test for every UDON tool surface: if the unverified path is easier than the verified one, the notation's guarantees will not be used.

## What this opens (ideas, not designs)

- ✦ **The self-audit as a standing instrument.** The October-2025 session audit happened once, by hand. Nothing prevents it from being a habit a harness prompts: every N tool calls, one cheap question — "what fraction of the last stretch was mechanical?" — with the answers accumulating into a measured, per-project 60/30/6/4 rather than a stated prior. The thesis would then grade its own numbers.
- ✦ **A crystallization-request channel.** An agent that notices 60-shaped friction mid-task currently just endures it. One could give that noticing somewhere to go — a standing file of tool-requests-from-lived -friction, so the tool suite grows from measured pain rather than from anticipation. (The refusal chapter's telemetry idea is this same move applied to errors.)
- ✦ **An ease-gradient audit.** The gradient claim is testable per harness: for a given operation, count the steps and tokens of the verified path versus the unverified one. Where the unverified path is cheaper, the post-mortem above predicts exactly what agents will do. A tool suite could be *linted* for wrong-way gradients.
- ✦ **The distribution as explicit dispatch.** Shipped harnesses embody the routing implicitly. It could be declared instead: per task-class, which layer (code / small model / large model / human) owns it — a routing table that is observable, arguable, and tunable, instead of folklore distributed through prompt text.

**Who reads this and when:** both consumers, early — it is the *why* under every tool-shaped demand in this report. The harness reads the distribution as architecture guidance; UDON reads the ease gradient as its design test.

## Honest edges

The 60/30/6/4 numbers are a stated prior, not a measurement — the one empirical check is the author's own single-session self-audit, and the whole ideological leg is one author's work (coherence, not corroboration; the ecosystem echo is this report's structural reading, not the harnesses citing the thesis). The distribution's *shape* — most friction is crystallizable — is better supported than its numbers. And the thesis carries its own disconfirmer: crystallization is right-sizing, not maximal tooling — a tool nobody needed is the over-engineering face of the same coin.

## Working Notes

**Two calibration notes on this chapter's evidence, both open.**

1. **The 60/30/6/4 distribution is `heuristic`, not `measured`.** It is stated in the estate design work as a considered proportion, not derived from a labelled task corpus. The chapter presents it as "the quantified form" of the thesis, which is fair as long as nobody downstream treats the four numbers as measurements. The evidence-action that would promote it: classify a real task sample against the four buckets and report the actual split. That is a cheap experiment and would move this from `heuristic` toward `measured`.
2. **The shipped-practice leg is structural, not citational** — harnesses behave *as if* the thesis were true (they encode process into tools) without anyone citing it. That is a real but weak independent signal: it is consistent with the thesis and also with several other explanations. I armed the lock on it; a stricter reading would not.
