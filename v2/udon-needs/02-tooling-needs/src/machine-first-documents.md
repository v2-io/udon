# Machine-first documents: the document is the interface, and sometimes the implementation

**Claim.** In at least four separate bodies of this research programme's
design work — and on three different runtime substrates — the same
conclusion keeps being reached: **the document is the natural unit of
agent-facing knowledge and configuration**, provided it is machine-first
(structured, dense, self-describing) rather than prose-first. In its
strongest form the document doesn't describe the system; it *is* the
system: "agents ARE documentation, not code that implements behavior."

## The evidence

- **The argument from failure.** A 2025 protocol for agent-facing
  knowledge documents opens with the indictment: prose documentation
  written for humans is an agent bottleneck. The ecosystem's own remedy
  attempts prove the point — machine-oriented `llms.txt` files ballooning
  past 800,000 tokens; the short variants devolving into link lists that
  push the parsing back onto the agent; scraped versions full of noise.
  The protocol's solution shape: maximize actionable knowledge per
  token, in structured sections that separate *what it is*
  (definitions), *how it works* (interactions), and *how to use it*
  (patterns), plus an applicability gate — when to select this
  knowledge, when not to, and what must be true first. "An agent cannot
  reliably use a tool if it only has an example snippet without its
  parameters or its error states." That four-way split is a
  document-format demand: knowledge-modality boundaries want to be
  *structural*, not stylistic.
- **"Agents are documents," three times, on three substrates.** One
  design makes an agent a markdown file — typed metadata up top, prose
  body — hot-reloaded and schema-validated, the running agent "literally
  read[ing] its own markdown to understand its purpose." One shipping
  harness carries agent definitions as markdown files with an
  output-contract template enforced by a 39-kilobyte linter — schema on
  the agent's *output*, machine-checked. And one shipped Elixir system
  compiles markdown documents directly into running processes — section
  headers become chapter boundaries, metadata becomes typed fields, and
  the transformation is simple enough that "a human can replay it by
  hand… documents become alive… zero magic." One author throughout —
  coherence, not corroboration — but three different execution
  environments, two of them shipped, is genuine re-derivation of one
  idea against three different walls.
- **The philosophical spine** (reproduced in
  [[the-pattern| the pattern statement]]): traditional
  documentation and code drift apart; a *compiled* document cannot —
  "documentation is always current — it IS the implementation." Its
  extended-mind framing — the document as cognitive scaffolding, part
  of the agent's mind rather than external storage — is the
  [[persistence-is-imported| persistence chapter]]'s reinjection
  channel, said with feeling.
- **The theory prices it.** Minimum implementation time is bounded
  below by the time to transmit the distinguishing information, given
  what sender and receiver already share — so **shared notation is
  compression**: conventions, schemas, and dense structure reduce what
  must be transmitted at all. As implementation automates,
  communication becomes the binding constraint, and a document format
  that hosts several channels in one artifact — prose, examples,
  structure, schema — is several sufficient channels in one
  transmission. One caveat travels with this: specification arriving
  faster than the receiver can integrate it is *worse* than
  under-specification.

## What it generates

- **For UDON:** this is the demand its core thesis answers, stated by
  its future consumers before the language rebooted: structure and
  prose in one object, typed metadata, schema-checkable, sections that
  are stable addressable units. The lineage also names the
  *governed-edit* requirement from the configuration side: the
  markdown-agent design treats editing the agent's own document as a
  transaction — validate, back up, swap, roll back — which is the
  [[schema-guarded-mutation| guarded-mutation chapter]]'s demand
  arriving by another road.
- **For the harness:** agent definitions, skills, procedures, and
  output contracts are one document class, and the 2025 protocol's
  metadata fields are a ready checklist — version, deprecation,
  dependencies, and *elaboration level*, with links to more- and
  less-elaborated variants of the same knowledge: progressive
  disclosure carried in the metadata. The counter-weight to hold: the
  one measured comprehension experiment
  ([[counter-register| counter-register]], row 1) failed to reproduce
  on one model family — density and structure are the evidenced wins;
  notational elegance is not yet one.

## What this opens (ideas, not designs)

- ✦ **Documents at N altitudes.** The elaboration-level metadata
  generalizes: one knowledge artifact maintained at several compression
  levels, each linking up and down, with the *agent choosing by context
  budget*. The context-economy machinery keeps proving documents get
  summarized anyway — this would make the summaries authored,
  versioned, and honest instead of ad hoc.
- ✦ **Applicability gates that execute.** The when-to-use / preconditions
  section is currently prose an agent reads. Stated as checkable
  conditions, the gate could *run* — knowledge that declines to apply
  itself out of scope, the way a well-designed tool refuses out-of-law
  calls.
- ✦ **The tool whose definition is its document.** This chapter and the
  [[tool-definition-anatomy| tool-anatomy chapter]] converge from two
  sides: if a tool's contract is a structured document and documents
  can compile to behavior, then a tool registry is a directory of
  documents — authored, diffed, schema-checked, and projected to
  vendor formats, with nothing hand-maintained twice.
- ✦ **Drift detection for living documents.** A compiled document cannot
  drift from its own behavior — but its claims about the *world* still
  can. Assertions in a living document could carry freshness marks
  (checked-against-what, when), so staleness becomes visible in the
  artifact rather than discovered in production.

## Honest edges

The breadth here is mostly one author re-deriving one conviction, plus a
single outside lineage (the `llms.txt` ecosystem's token-bloat pain).
"Documents compile to behavior" has two shipped instances, both small;
nothing tests it at scale or under adversarial edits. And the strongest
form of the thesis quietly assumes the governed-edit and validation
tooling already exists — without it, living documents drift exactly
like dead ones, just with more authority.
