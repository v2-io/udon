# The demand: schema-guarded structural mutation

**Claim.** The clearest single demand in this entire report: an edit
surface where an agent mutates a document **structurally** — the target
named by a path, spans spliced precisely, indentation and escaping owned
by the tool — with the mutation **validated inside the write**: no
change is accepted that would make the document violate its declared
schema, and a refused mutation returns a law-rich, menu-shaped error and
touches nothing. The previous chapter established that no shipping tool
provides this — every shipped editor works at the text level with no
validity guarantee. Every kind of evidence this report holds asks for
it.

## The demand, witness by witness

- **Stated directly by the project's owner** during the deliberations
  that reoriented this design effort (mid-2026): "a critical tool IMO
  for agents is a specialized edit tool that makes edits very easy
  without needing to worry about indent-levels for prose or raw code
  blocks, while simultaneously guaranteeing that no mutation that would
  cause the document to now violate the schema is accepted. The tool
  itself will need the machinery to do jq/yq like span-sensitive
  changes to the AST and have it checked against a static schema." The
  same demand runs through years of his design work in other dress: a
  document store that validates structure at the write boundary, with
  the schema declaration part of the document's own identity; a
  pattern-language whose first layer is "make invalid states
  unrepresentable"; write-path rules that insist on validating *inside*
  the write rather than after it, on one-call resolution rather than
  edit-check-revert loops, and on the file's own declared schema
  governing ("declared ≠ theater").
- **The shipping ecosystem has the gap and the near-misses.** The whole
  tolerance-ladder apparatus is compensation for unguaranteed text
  edits. One harness bolts secret-scanning onto edits *after* they land
  (guard-after — the weaker form). The yq tool demonstrates structural
  path-assignment with no schema guard. A popular linter's own
  maintainers admit its rules don't compose. Nobody has the
  validated-transaction shape.
- **The measured wound** (December 2025; [[yaml-stress-test| the YAML stress
  test]] reproduces it whole). Three
  agents, an adversarial protocol: one writes valid data, a second
  introduces a specific corruption, a third — fresh context, no human —
  attempts recovery. Six corruption scenarios; their outcomes, verbatim
  from the test:

  | Corruption | Recoverable? | Method | Without backup |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | Truncated write (crash mid-write) | ✓ | restore from backup | ✗ failed |
  | Invalid YAML syntax (generation bug) | ✓ | auto-fix heuristic OR backup | ⚠ maybe |
  | Schema violation (valid YAML, wrong shape) | ✓ | backup, after a validation layer catches it | ✗ failed |
  | **Duplicate keys** | ✗ **silent failure** | none — undetectable | ✗ failed |
  | Partial update | ✓ | binary-search salvage OR backup | ⚠ maybe, loses data |
  | Circular reference (anchor misuse) | ✓ | backup, after cycle detection | ✗ failed |

  Headline: **recovery drops from ~100% to 16% — one scenario in six —
  without backup infrastructure.** And the one failure backups don't
  fix is the quiet one. Duplicate keys parse cleanly: the parser raises
  nothing, the last value wins, the earlier values are silently gone —

  ```yaml
  - id: "task-1"
    name: "Implement feature X"
    status: pending
    name: "Implement feature Y"   # parses fine; X is lost forever
  ```

  "Can agent detect this? NO — YAML parser doesn't warn about
  duplicates. Can agent recover? NO — earlier values are gone forever.
  Human intervention required: YES (to notice data inconsistency)." The
  team's four resulting requirements — backup before every write,
  validation after every read, salvage heuristics, human escalation —
  amount to ~500 lines of infrastructure built around a format that did
  nothing to help. Read from the wound side, the demand is exact: every
  scenario a schema-checking write gate refuses at the door is a
  scenario the next agent never has to recover from — and the
  undetectable one is refusable *only* at the door, because after the
  write there is nothing left to detect. (UDON's own attribute law is
  the other half of this defense: repeated keys are *kept, in order*,
  by core rule — the silent last-wins that destroyed task X is the
  behavior UDON already refuses.)
- **Lived, adjacently.** An agent's own post-mortem of a system it
  broke three times: chaining unverified edits "was the easiest path."
  The tool's own audience asking for the verified path to be the easy
  path — this chapter's demand, in first person.
- **The theory.** A schema converts an interpretive observation ("does
  this look right?") into a pass/fail one — the sharpest-signal move
  the [[tools-are-observation-infrastructure| observation chapter]]
  prices; a typed write boundary is one of its two separation
  mechanisms; and the [[errors-that-teach| refusal chapter]] makes
  atomicity of refusals an epistemic requirement, not politeness.
- **External research keeps rediscovering the absence from outside:**
  malformed-call and fabricated-parameter failures attributed to
  insufficient schema grounding (the
  [[structured-output-two-mechanisms| structured-output chapter]]
  carries the numbers and their scope), and the largest
  execution-failure subcategory in a 2026 fault-taxonomy study of the
  Model Context Protocol ecosystem is schema-serialization mismatch.

## The shape the evidence pins (and what stays open)

Pinned — consistent across the design sources:

```text
re-resolve path against current file → mutate assembly model
→ syntax-validate → (if schema bound) conformance check
→ span-splice write   — one atomic transaction; refusal mutates nothing
```

with a staged first version honestly available: syntax-valid,
indent-correct, atomic first; schema conformance next.

Open, deliberately — the design work ahead must decide: whether the
schema is static or composable ("can schemas be nested or otherwise
composable?… or is the schema static?" — the owner's own open
questions, from the same discussion as the edit-tool demand); the path
language itself (the [[addressing-is-the-long-pole| addressing chapter]]);
the serialization substrate that makes span-splicing exact (the
[[round-trip-and-span-splice| round-trip chapter]]); and where guard
strictness lives — the design work sketches enforcement *profiles*
(casual / careful / critical: same notation, different strictness),
with the agent edit tool as the careful gatekeeper.

## What this opens (ideas, not designs)

- ✦ **One guard, three doors.** The same conformance engine could stand
  at generation time (grammar/schema-constrained emission), at edit
  time (this chapter's transaction), and at review time (batch CI
  checking) — one schema, three enforcement points, so a document is
  guarded whether it was born, changed, or merged into shape. Nothing
  requires three separate validators; nobody has built the unified one.
- ✦ **Refusals that carry the repair.** A guarded refusal knows exactly
  which constraint failed. It could return the *nearest conforming
  version* of the attempted edit as a diff — "not this, but here is
  the closest thing that would be accepted." The refusal chapter's
  error-as-menu, upgraded to error-as-counteroffer.
- ✦ **Schema-aware merge.** Two agents editing the same document
  concurrently is a documented collision class. Structural mutation
  suggests structural *merge*: both edits applied to the model (not
  the text), conformance checked on the merged result, conflicts
  reported in path vocabulary rather than diff hunks. The multi-writer
  problem inherits the guard.
- ✦ **Guarding the markdown-era estate.** The harness's divergence note
  below has an answering idea: conventions-as-schema. The harness's
  existing plain-markdown artifacts follow implicit rules; stated as a
  lightweight schema, the same write gate could guard them *today*,
  before any notation migration — which would also measure how much
  guarding is worth, on the corpus that motivated it.

**Who reads this and when:** UDON reads it as the flagship utility the
design decisions ahead must enable — it pulls paths, schema, spans, and
round-trip at once, which is *why* it is the long-pole customer. The
harness reads it as the write-path contract for any document-shaped
state agents maintain (memory files, tracking documents,
identity-defining files), where "schema" may be the harness's own
invariants rather than a UDON schema. Divergence to keep visible: the
harness needs this for its *plain-markdown-era* artifacts too — a
UDON-only tool leaves its present corpus unguarded.

## Honest edges

The demand's breadth is real but its legs differ in kind: the owner's
design line is decided intent; the stress test is one measured protocol
on one format; the first-person account is adjacent (it asks for
verification-made-easy, not for schemas by name); and the external
studies indict ungrounded structure generally, not this design
specifically. No one has yet built the guarded transaction and measured
what it saves — that experiment is the point of the design work this
chapter exists to inform.
