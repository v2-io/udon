# What the human on the other side needs

**Claim.** The human steering and verifying agent work is a first-class
tool consumer, and the evidence — thin on this side, and this chapter
says so plainly — converges on three needs: **structured decision
surfaces** (not free-text interrogation), **explicit trust boundaries**
(currently a live disagreement in shipping practice), and above all
**verification surfaces matched to the plausible-wrongness reality**,
because the one failure class nothing mechanical catches is the one
only a human *using the product* notices.

## The evidence

- **Verification is the load-bearing need — measured, externally.** In
  the production system the [[counter-register| counter-register]]
  documents, about 70% of silent failures were caught by a human
  observing the product as a user, and essentially none by its 4,286
  tests — "audits are regression engines, not prediction engines." The
  distinctive failure mode turns internal errors into confident,
  coherent, *false* output (an HTTP error log synthesized into a
  fabricated analysis). Medium confidence, one system — but it inverts
  the usual priority: the human surface is not the fallback after
  automation; it is the **only** catch for the failure class automation
  creates.
- **Observability as architecture (September 2025).** The programme's
  multi-agent coordination design made human steering a *filesystem
  property*: agents work in observable markdown streams anchored by a
  shared task list, so the human can watch them think in real time
  ("Joseph can `tail -f` these files") and intervene *by editing the
  documents they are working from*. The failure it was built against is
  still everywhere: the relay pattern, where a lead agent becomes
  "mediator/translator… telephone game," and the human loses sight of
  the actual work. Steering by shared artifact beats steering by relay.
- **Structured decision surfaces, shipped everywhere.** The converged
  ask-the-user shape — a few questions, a few options each, a
  recommended one, always a free-text escape — is one influential
  design adopted ecosystem-wide: survivorship evidence that structured
  choice presentation beat open-ended asking wherever it landed. Its
  complement is propose-before-apply: a preview product carrying the
  diff, the validation result, the side-effects, and the confidence
  (the [[progressive-disclosure-read-path| read-path chapter]] carries
  the product shape).
- **Trust boundaries are genuinely unsettled.** Most of the ecosystem
  treats per-directory instruction files as authoritative; one harness
  treats them as *untrusted data* under injection-precedence rules
  (the [[counter-register| counter-register]], row 6). Security-
  relevant, unresolved — a harness must choose, and say what it chose.
- **The bootstrapping datum.** A source-level survey of the shipping
  CLIs (conducted within this research programme) records the tools
  increasingly being built *by* agents — bot fleets filing, reviewing,
  and merging changes; agent-written specification folders preceding
  implementation. Human verification is becoming review-of-agent-work
  all the way down, which raises the stakes on diff legibility,
  provenance, and the plausible-wrongness catch rather than lowering
  them.

## What it generates

- **For the harness:** fund the human surface as the plausible-
  wrongness control, not as UX polish — propose/dry-run previews
  wherever mutation exists; work in observable artifacts instead of
  relay reports; an explicit, stated instruction-trust policy; and
  agent-work diffs designed for human reading. Authoring ergonomics
  and review bottlenecks are under-sampled in this report's evidence —
  treat that absence as missing data, not as low demand.
- **For UDON:** the human is the second reader of every agent-facing
  design in this report. Skeletons, structural diffs, and provenance
  annotations are dual-consumer surfaces by construction — "crystal
  clear even without syntax highlighting" is the human-side clause of
  the notation's original thesis. And steering-by-editing-shared-
  documents is a *document-format* use case: the human edits the very
  artifact the agent reads, which is the whole two-audience bet.

## What this opens (ideas, not designs)

> [!capability] Scheduled use-the-product verification
> **What:** the fail-plausible catch made a budgeted ritual — sampled
> sessions where a human (or a deliberately naive agent) *uses* the
> product rather than auditing its internals, on a cadence scaled to
> mutation volume.
> **Principles that apply:** validation catches malformation, not
> plausible wrongness; the human surface as the only known control.
> **Hypothesized impact:** adds the one observation channel with
> access to the failure class tests structurally miss — in the
> theory's terms, a channel whose error profile is *independent* of
> the automated channels, which is precisely the condition under which
> adding a channel adds real tempo rather than redundancy.
> **In tension with:** cost (human attention is the scarcest budget in
> the loop); the crystallization instinct (this is deliberately
> uncrystallized watching).
> **Potential downsides:** sampling can miss; ritualized "use it for
> five minutes" degrades into the checkbox it was invented to replace.

> [!capability] The review-grade diff
> **What:** a diff product built for the human reviewer of agent work:
> structural (what changed, in path vocabulary), provenance-carrying
> (who/what session), and intent-anchored (the
> [[intent-as-parameter| intent chapter]]'s stated purpose shown
> beside the change, so the reviewer checks the diff *against* it).
> **Principles that apply:** byte-preserving mutation (reformat noise
> is review poison); intent as the verification anchor.
> **Hypothesized impact:** cuts comprehension time per review — the
> cost the theory multiplies by every future reader — and gives the
> plausible-wrongness check something concrete to check against;
> hypothesis: reviewer catch-rate rises when the claimed purpose sits
> beside the actual change.
> **In tension with:** diff-tool inertia (line diffs are universal
> infrastructure).
> **Potential downsides:** a bad structural diff is worse than a good
> line diff; intent display invites rubber-stamping "matches stated
> intent" without asking if the intent was right.

> [!capability] Bidirectional steering documents
> **What:** the `tail -f` pattern completed: agents treat their own
> briefs and working documents as *live* — watching for mid-flight
> human edits as first-class steering input, with the edit surfaced to
> the agent as an event rather than discovered on next read.
> **Principles that apply:** steering by shared artifact; documents as
> the human-agent interface.
> **Hypothesized impact:** provides exactly the out-of-band intent
> channel the theory's objective-capture analysis says recovery
> requires — a correction path that does not route through the channel
> being corrected. Steering latency drops from
> whenever-the-agent-rereads to now.
> **In tension with:** interiority (an agent constantly interrupted by
> document edits never settles into its own loop — the same
> trust-as-temporal-respect the theory demands of composite minds).
> **Potential downsides:** live edits race agent writes (the
> [[freshness-and-atomicity| freshness chapter]]'s multi-writer
> problem, now with the human as second writer — leases apply to
> people too).

## Honest edges

This is the report's thinnest evidentiary base: one external case study
(medium confidence), one September-2025 design, survivorship-grade
shipped shapes, and a survey aside. Late-arriving evidence is expected
here and the coverage notes welcome it. What is absent outright: any
human-subject measurement — review times, steering-error rates,
catch-rates. Everything above is builder-side reasoning about the
human, not observation of one.
