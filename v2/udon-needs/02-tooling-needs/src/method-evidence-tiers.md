# What this report counts as evidence

Every claim in this report can be placed — by a reader, from the prose alone —
on **three axes** and under **two locks**. The axes say *what kind of support a
claim has*, *how strong it is*, and *what kind of claim it is*. The locks say
*whether independent kinds of support agree* and *whether the claim was checked
at its source*. None of this apparatus needs to surface while reading; the prose
carries what a reader must know in plain words, and the frontmatter carries the
rest so the whole report is machine-auditable.

The reason for three axes rather than one blended label: **the axes vary
independently, and collapsing them hides exactly the mistakes this report is
most prone to.** A claim from the formal theory can be exploratory; a claim from
a single agent's testimony can be a measurement. Reading "formal theory" as
automatically strong, or "one agent's account" as automatically weak, is the
error the separation prevents.

## Axis 1 — support-kind (how the evidence was produced, and how it fails)

Each kind is defined by its **repair**: the move that would strengthen a claim
of that kind, or discharge it. The repair is the useful part — it tells a later
agent what to *do* with a claim, and (by the anti-collapse test the formal
theory uses on its own vocabulary) two kinds are worth distinguishing only when
they route to different repairs. These six do.

| Support-kind | What it is | Repair (what strengthens or discharges it) |
|---|---|---|
| **design** | first-principles design reasoning, not yet exercised against reality (the 2025–26 agent-interface principles) | ground-validate: build it and see whether reality bears the reasoning |
| **observational** | a regularity seen across shipped systems or agent behavior | replicate it elsewhere **and descent-correct** — is the agreement independent, or one design copied? |
| **testimonial** | a first-person account from an agent of a tool serving or failing it | corroborate: independent voices, ideally across substrates |
| **theoretic** | a formal result — almost always **transmitted** from the theory, not derived here (see *Transmission*) | check the proof, or check the named premises hold in this domain |
| **measured** *(self / ext)* | an in-the-wild or benchmark quantity — `ext` = external published, `self` = our own recorded run | replicate; re-measure at wider conditions; corroborate the source |
| **synthetic** | evidence from constructed scenarios that were actually run (the stress tests) | validate that the scenarios are *representative*; re-run under variation |

**Kind is routed by repair, not by surface — a numeral does not force
`measured`.** "Eleven of fourteen harnesses use exact-match editing" is
`observational`: the claim rests on the *regularity's independence*, and its
repair is descent-correction (are the eleven independent arrivals or one design
copied?). "Format choice moved pass@1 from 14% to 57%" is `measured`: the claim
rests on the *effect size*, and its repair is re-measurement at wider
conditions. Same numeral-shaped surface, different kind, because the kind tracks
what the claim rests on and therefore how it is repaired. (This is the rule the
frontmatter sweep applies when tagging chapters; it is easy to route every count
to `measured` on sight, and wrong.)

The kind tracks a claim's *current* support, not its origin: a `design` idea that
later ships and is observed working becomes `observational` (its live repair is
now replication), and the `design` leg persists only as the earlier, still-honest
statement of the same idea.

## Axis 2 — strength (how defeasible the claim is)

A single graded ladder, borrowed almost whole from the formal theory's own
status vocabulary, extended with two rungs this report needs for empirical and
imaginative claims:

| Strength rung | What it means here |
|---|---|
| **exact** | A measurement or closed-form result; defeasible only if someone finds a mistake (detection rate zero; a theorem's algebra). "Exact" already carries that humility — do not pay for it twice by down-tiering. |
| **conditional** | A theorem-grade result that holds *under named premises* that travel with every use (the κ×A bias law; the persistence threshold). As strong as exact *given* its premises. |
| **robust-qualitative** | A direction or ordering that holds across many cases and would survive most reasonable perturbations, without a precise magnitude. |
| **measured** | An empirical number with its measurement conditions attached — carrying the caveats the source stated (single-repo, one model family, benchmark-era, N=…). Strong *at* its conditions, silent beyond them. |
| **heuristic** | A working rule that earns its keep in practice but has no proof and known exceptions. |
| **hypothesis** | A prediction not yet tested — every *proposed*-register claim lands here by construction. |
| **discussion-grade** | Reasoning offered to frame or provoke, explicitly not load-bearing; honest about being a starting point. |

The ladder is not a ranking to climb — a claim sits at the rung its support
actually reaches, and "measured" is not "better than" "conditional"; they answer
different questions. Where a claim's strength is load-bearing the prose *says the
rung in words* ("measured, single repo"; "conditional on the drift assumption");
the frontmatter carries it so an auditor can sort by it.

## Axis 3 — register (what kind of claim this is, as a speech act)

Every claim is exactly one of four kinds, and the prose is written so a reader
can tell which without apparatus:

- **Derived** — it follows from common knowledge or stated premises, and the
  reasoning is on the page.
- **Evidenced** — observation, measurement, or testimony supports it, cited
  where it stands.
- **Decided** — someone chose: a scope call, a convention, a project ruling.
  Decisions are legitimate — design runs on them — but they are never dressed
  up as derivations. Where the project's owner made a call, the text says so
  plainly (usually a link to the [[DECISIONS.md|design ledger]]) rather than
  manufacturing an argument that arrives where the decision already stood; and
  where a decision merely confirmed something obvious, the text says *that*.
- **Proposed** — an idea, generated here. This report is not only an
  organization of what exists; each chapter is chartered to *think* — to notice
  what its principles make conceivable that nobody has yet said. Such passages
  are voiced unmistakably as imagination ("one could…", "nothing yet built
  does…"), open possibility space without closing any of it, and decide
  nothing — the design work downstream owns that. **Proposed content is marked
  visibly** as **capability cards**: callout blocks `> [!capability] <name>`
  carrying, as a strong default, what it is · the principles that apply · the
  **hypothesized impact on the agent**, stated in the theory's precise
  vocabulary wherever that is the exact fit (observation ambiguity, update gain,
  tempo and the persistence condition, reinjection strength, law-teaching
  density, the context description-length budget… the full survey is
  [[theory-of-agentic-tooling| the theory report]]) — because that vocabulary
  names every aspect of an agent's fitness · what it stands in tension with ·
  its downsides. The last two fields are the point: cards that name their own
  costs are what let the later priority stages weigh capabilities *against one
  another* instead of inheriting a verdict. A card whose territory genuinely
  lacks a field says so rather than manufacturing content. That a report like
  this must *invent* a typographic convention to mark a claim's register is
  itself a small demand datum for the notation work: registers-on-content is
  exactly what a structure-and-prose format could carry natively.

## How the axes cross

The three axes are orthogonal, and the machinery is smaller than it looks
because two of the crossings are fixed:

- **Support-kind × strength cross freely.** A testimonial can be `hypothesis`
  (one voice) or `robust-qualitative` (corroborated across substrates); a
  `measured` outcome can be `measured`-strength or, at a single unreplicated
  data point, `heuristic`. Kind and strength move independently — the clearest
  proof is that strengthening a claim usually happens by *adding or changing its
  support-kind*, not by re-asserting it (below, *Max-attainable-status*).
- **Register fixes strength at two of its four values.** Only the two
  *truth-apt* registers take a strength rung. A **decided** claim takes none — a
  decision is not strong-or-weak; asking "how confident are we that we *chose*
  X?" is a category error (the question is only "did we choose it," and the
  answer is yes). A **proposed** claim is `hypothesis` by definition. So
  strength is carried only on the **derived** and **evidenced** claims; the
  other two self-tag.

So the per-claim machinery reduces to: **support-kind and register on every
claim; strength on the derived and evidenced ones.** The two locks below sit on
top.

## Lock 1 — convergent (does independent support agree?)

Agreement across kinds of evidence is this report's actual unit of proof. But
`convergent` is **not a rung on the strength ladder** — it is a lock computed on
top of it: a claim is `convergent` when **two or more support-kinds with
independent failure modes** agree. A convergent claim still has a strength
ceiling; the lock raises confidence *within* that ceiling by ruling out the
failure mode any single kind is prone to.

**The lock keys on failure-mode independence, and that is the whole
discipline.** Within-kind corroboration — two testimonials, three shipped tools
doing the same thing — raises *strength* (a stronger testimonial, a wider
observation) but does **not** arm the lock, because same-kind sources share a
failure mode. Two de-novo testimonials from different substrates are still one
kind of evidence with one blind spot; more voices do not make an interpretation
*correct*. This is the report's own same-lineage-blind-spot thesis applied to
its own epistemology, and the frontmatter enforces it: `convergent:` lists
**kinds**, never same-kind sources.

**The repair for a convergent claim is: break the independence** — show that two
legs actually share a failure mode (descent from one source is the usual
culprit). If the independence breaks, the lock voids and the claim falls back to
its strongest single leg. This is what makes descent-correction *mechanical*
rather than a matter of remembering to be careful.

**Worked example (the lock spec's canonical case):**
[[errors-that-teach| #errors-that-teach]] presents its refuse-on-multi-match
principle as four-kind convergent — `design` (the built refusal tool),
`observational` (eleven of fourteen shipping harnesses), `testimonial` (an
agent's own account of the damage its absence causes), and `theoretic` (the
law-teaching condition). But the `observational` leg is *mostly one influential
design copied across the ecosystem* — so it is one partially-self-correlated leg,
not a fourth independent failure mode. The honest lock is **three independent
kinds plus a descent-echo**, not four independent kinds — and the chapter says
so. The lock's failure-mode key is exactly what forces that audit instead of
letting "4-tier convergent" stand unexamined.

## Lock 2 — transmission (was the claim checked at its source?)

This report mostly **transmits** the formal theory — it inherits results rather
than deriving them. A transmitted claim is defeasible on **two independent
grounds**: the source could be wrong, *or* our carriage of it could be
infidelious. That second ground is real and this report has already caught
itself on it (the κ×A "one knob" claim needed a wrapping caveat added so faithful
carriage did not overclaim the source).

The encoding is deliberately light, because the eventual home — a group within
ASF's software volume — already has the machinery. A transmitted claim is a
**cross-volume reference** into the theory:
[[scope-channel-collapse| #asf/llm/scope-channel-collapse]] carries the source's
own status by reference; there is no separate "inherited" strength label (that
would launder a non-exact source and duplicate what the reference already says).
Two obligations travel with every transmitted claim:

1. **Prose form**, wherever a reader could mistake inheritance for local
   derivation: *"exact at source, under its premises; the risk here is
   carriage."*
2. **Plain-word gloss**, so a reader who cannot follow the reference still gets
   the substance on the page (the standalone-ownership bar).

The carriage-fidelity risk is **audited in the verification-event log**, not
stamped as a label — "restatement checked against #asf/llm/scope-channel-collapse
on DATE." And the honest-staleness note: an event records a check *as of a date*.
A source segment can change after that date; inside ASF a `depends:` edge closes
this automatically (the source's downgrade cascades to its dependents), but while
this report is still a separate corpus there is no live edge, so **a known change
in a referenced source is a re-verify trigger** — staleness is honest about the
source, not only about our own prose.

## The verification-event log

Verification is recorded as an **append-only event stream**, not as a status a
chapter attains and holds. (The four rigor checks a segment can pass — dependency
audit, content review, mechanical, notes-disposition — are re-runnable
instruments, not a ladder; a living document under flux gets re-checked, not
re-certified.) Each chapter's frontmatter carries a `verified:` list; each entry
records **what was verified · against what · by whom · when** — never "what state
was attained":

```
verified:
  - 2026-07-22 · deps-audit · pilot-A · depends-chain present and at-or-above this chapter
  - 2026-07-22 · source · pilot-A · κ×A carriage checked against #asf/llm/scope-channel-collapse; wrapping caveat added
  - 2026-07-22 · deliberately-corrected-away · pilot-A · "5 harnesses vote" was one origin copied 5× — do not restore the cleaner count
```

The third kind earns its keep: a **`deliberately-corrected-away` event** records
a form that was corrected *away from* on purpose, so a future re-verifier who
notices the corrected truth reads messier than the original is told **not to "fix
it back."** (Corrected truth is usually messier than what it replaced; without
this marker, the next careful reader re-introduces the error in good faith.) An
event goes stale honestly — a later edit can invalidate a prior event; the event
stays, dated, and the next check appends.

## The frontmatter machinery (what an auditor sorts by)

Each chapter carries the axes and locks as fields, so the report is
machine-auditable without any of this surfacing in the reading experience:

- `register:` — the dominant speech-act kind(s) (`derived` / `evidenced` /
  `decided` / `proposed`).
- `support-kind:` — the kinds present (`design` / `observational` /
  `testimonial` / `theoretic` / `measured` `(self|ext)` / `synthetic`). Replaces
  the retired `evidence: [T…]`.
- `strength:` — the headline claim's rung, for truth-apt chapters; a `decided`
  or purely `proposed` chapter omits it, and in-body claims that diverge carry
  their rung in prose.
- `convergent:` — the **kinds** whose independent-failure-mode agreement arms
  the lock, listed so the claim is auditable, not asserted (never same-kind
  sources).
- `verified:` — the append-only event log above.
- `stage:` — draft maturity, wholly separate from all of the above.

### Claim grain — proportionate, not per-line

The native claim-grain unit is the **capability card** (all cards are
`proposed` / `hypothesis`). Load-bearing body claims that diverge from a
chapter's headline carry their rung inline, in words. A **"what each leg
carries" mini-table** — one row per claim, giving its support-kind and strength —
is warranted **only** for chapters carrying three or more load-bearing claims at
mixed strength: today those are
[[typing-and-schema-boundary| #typing-and-schema-boundary]],
[[context-economy| #context-economy]],
[[edit-representation-landscape| #edit-representation-landscape]],
[[counter-register| #counter-register]] (which *is* such a table already), and
[[tools-are-observation-infrastructure| #tools-are-observation-infrastructure]].
No LaTeX-style equation tags — that is costume rigor for a report with few
equations of its own.

### Max-attainable-status — the ceiling, and the action that raises it

Every claim has a ceiling: the strongest status it could *ever* reach. Note it
where the ceiling is not obvious — *"Max attainable: measured. Currently
hypothesis because no experiment has run."* — because knowing the ceiling makes
strengthen-before-softening tractable (push to the ceiling, then stop) and
prevents the false-modesty under-claim (don't leave something at
`discussion-grade` when its ceiling is `measured` and the experiment is cheap).

And name the **evidence-action** that would move the claim, not just the ceiling
value — because a ceiling is almost always raised by *adding or changing a
support-kind*, which turns the whole system into a strengthen-before-soften
to-do generator. Promoting "no silent retype" from `design` to `measured` is not
more thinking — it is running the Norway-suite (`design` → `synthetic` / `measured`).
Arming a lone testimonial's convergence is not re-asserting it — it is adding an
independent kind. A capability card *is* such an action in disguise: it names the
experiment that would move its own claim off `hypothesis`.

## The discipline this report holds itself to

1. **Agreement across independent kinds is the unit of proof** — the
   convergent lock above, with its failure-mode key. Most of the design work has
   one author; agreement between his own projects is coherence, not
   corroboration, and does not arm the lock.
2. **Shipped-practice counts are descent-corrected — and survivorship still
   carries positive design weight.** Much of the uniformity across shipping
   harnesses is inheritance from one or two influential designs, not independent
   invention: the patch-envelope format traces to a single published origin with
   zero independent arrivals; the ubiquitous exact-replace edit tool and the
   todo-list shape are convention-adoption of one design. Uniformity-by-descent
   is weak evidence that agents *need* a thing but strong evidence of what
   current models are trained against — a real design input, not a deflated
   count. Two patterns survive the correction as genuinely independent arrivals —
   the graduated fuzzy-match ladder and the headless I/O contract — and arm the
   lock at full weight.
3. **A claim's status is limited by its weakest *necessary* premise** — not by
   the mere presence of a weaker supporting source (that would punish honest
   inclusion of thin evidence), and not laundered upward by a strong source that
   supports only part of the claim. Each chapter says which part of its claim
   each kind of evidence carries. And the characteristic failure of synthesis
   writing — firming up caveats the sources stated carefully — is named here so
   it can be checked: where a source said "conditional," "single-repo," or
   "2024-era numbers," the chapter says so too.
4. **Counter-evidence rides adjacent to the claims it qualifies**
   ([[counter-register| #counter-register]]), never in a footnote graveyard.
5. **Theory results are conditional theorems, not vibes** — and the conditions
   travel with every use (the bias bound's named sub-scopes; the deliberation
   threshold's drift assumption).

If a passage seems to argue hard for something that needed no argument, treat it
as a defect in this report and flag it.

One further fact about evidence, learned while writing this report: **readable,
principled analysis is itself an elicitation channel.** When a chapter lays its
territory out from first principles, readers remember things no search would have
surfaced — shipped precedents, old rationales, buried counter-examples latent
until good analysis fired the recall. (The addressing chapter's project-root
anchor arrived exactly this way: the owner had forgotten a shipped precedent
entirely until the principled treatment made it vivid again.) So late-arriving
evidence is not a gathering failure; it is the analysis working, and this report
is built to absorb it additively.

## Auditor's mapping note (historical — not live vocabulary)

The gathering apparatus tagged evidence with codes **T1–T5**, which appear
throughout the provenance files. They are retired from this report's live
vocabulary; the support-kind axis replaces them. The mapping, kept only so older
files stay decodable:

| Retired code | Was | Now (support-kind) |
|---|---|---|
| T1 | first-principles design work | `design` |
| T2 | shipped-harness practice | `observational` |
| T3 | first-person agent testimony | `testimonial` |
| T4 | formal theory (ASF/AAT) | `theoretic` (usually transmitted) |
| T5 | external published research | `measured (ext)` — or `synthetic` for constructed-scenario studies |

**Who reads this and when:** both consumers, first — any downstream use of this
report's claims should apply these axes and locks rather than re-deriving or
ignoring them.
