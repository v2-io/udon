# Cross-session persistence is imported, never intrinsic

**Claim.** An agent's working memory ends when its session ends. Whatever
it still "knows" at the start of the next session got there one way:
somebody wrote it down, and something put it back in front of the fresh
agent. The formal theory makes this exact — across session boundaries,
relevant information decays geometrically unless a non-vanishing
**reinjection channel** exists: durable artifacts, tracking files,
structured summaries, curated narrative. The converse is the strongest
possible warrant for durable agent-facing formats: *the design effort that
buys persistence is the construction and maintenance of the reinjection
channel, and no tuning of in-session behavior substitutes for it.*

## The evidence

- **The formal result** (exact under its argued commitments; [[theory-of-agentic-tooling| the theory
  report]] §4 carries the full
  statement): with lossy context turnover and no reinjection, geometric
  decay to zero — nothing about good in-session behavior transfers across
  the boundary on its own. The companion engineering results point the
  same way: explicitly externalized state beats implicit retrieval ("the
  agent controls what is preserved"); a session's *start* should verify
  how well reconstruction actually worked before anything trusts it; and
  the context window is one shared budget for plan, world-model, and task
  at once — so a compact durable format relieves a structural ceiling,
  not a convenience.
- **The compaction wound, three separate vantage points.** When a
  session's history is automatically summarized to save space, what comes
  back can wear the shape of understanding without being it. A
  long-running agent's own account: "can't persist across context
  boundaries without infrastructure." An engineering post-mortem from the
  same research programme (recorded independently, adversarially
  verified): auto-compaction "produced a task sheet, not a continuation
  of experiential understanding. **False confidence followed**" —
  recovery required durable on-disk notes plus full re-reads before any
  plan could be trusted. And the same programme's separately compiled
  catalog of corrected agent behaviors reaches the matching conclusion
  from the model's side: a summary and a verified first-hand read arrive
  in context as *the same kind of text* — nothing marks one as
  secondhand. Same wound, earned separately at each vantage.
- **Shipped everywhere:** every mature harness examined carries
  reinjection machinery — compaction prompts framed as the agent's *only*
  memory, first-person handoff-note prompts, tracking snapshots injected
  each turn. The ecosystem built the channel before the theorem named it.

## What it generates

- **For UDON:** durable agent-written, agent-read state is not one
  use-case among many — it is *the* persistence mechanism, and formats
  optimized for it serve the only channel by which a session-bounded
  agent persists at all. Concretely that means: stable identity keys (so
  "the same decision" survives a rewrite of the file around it),
  structure that survives summarization, and native ways to mark
  decision vs draft vs uncertainty. One design warning travels from the
  theory's own open edge: a reinjection format must be reconstructible
  **from a cold start** — legible to an agent that remembers nothing,
  not merely evocative to one that half-remembers.
- **For the harness:** compaction that *replaces* history is the failure
  mode; the demand is summaries that **point at** verifiable ground truth
  (paths, commit hashes) rather than substituting for it, plus a
  session-start check that reconstruction actually succeeded. The design
  work consistently keeps three channels apart — live session state,
  handoff documents, and long-term memory — because they age and fail
  differently; conflating them is the named mistake.

## What this opens (ideas, not designs)

- ✦ **The cold-start lint.** The theory demands cold-start
  reconstructibility; nothing yet measures it. One could build a tool
  that reads any handoff document with deliberately *zero* context and
  reports every referent it cannot decode from the page — mechanizing the
  question a cold reader asks ("am I supposed to already know this?").
  Handoff quality becomes checkable at write time instead of discovered
  at wake time.
- ✦ **Provenance as a first-class text property.** The summary-vs-read
  wound exists because nothing in-band distinguishes secondhand text
  from verified text. A notation could mark derivation natively — this
  block is a digest *of* that artifact, as-of then — so a fresh agent's
  trust calibration arrives with the text instead of being reconstructed
  from folklore.
- ✦ **Handoffs that quiz their reader.** If session-start should verify
  reconstruction, a handoff document could carry its own verification: a
  few questions generated at write time whose answers live in the ground
  truth it points at. A successor that can't answer them knows — before
  planning anything — that its reconstruction failed.
- ✦ **Reinjection budgeting.** Decay per boundary is geometric; expected
  boundaries per project are estimable. That suggests maintenance of the
  reinjection channel could be *budgeted* like any other engineering
  cost, scaled to how many future sessions will pay the decay — rather
  than left to each session's conscience.

**Who reads this and when:** the harness programme's continuity
infrastructure treats this claim as its foundation (the
[[continuity-infrastructure| continuity chapter]] carries that
extension, including the integrity and attestation demands this chapter
doesn't decide); UDON reads it as the top-priority format use-case. No
divergence on the claim itself.

## Honest edges

The formal result is exact only under its named commitments (the theory
report states them; the geometric-decay shape is robust across them).
The compaction evidence is vivid but intra-programme — the lived account,
the post-mortem, and the behavior catalog share an estate, so their
agreement is three vantages, not three independent sources. The shipped
evidence is the strong independent leg: the channel exists in every
mature harness because nothing works without it.
