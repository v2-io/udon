# Structured context-injection is perception design

**Claim.** The recurring "tracking snapshot" — a structured frame
injected into an agent's context carrying elapsed time, environment
state, queue visibility, and budget — is not user-interface convenience
leaking into a prompt. It is **designed perception**: the deliberate
construction of the observation channels an embodied creature gets for
free and a language-borne agent otherwise simply lacks. It was built in
2025, specified the same year, and the formal theory later derived why
it is structural.

## The evidence

- **Built, then specified (2025).** A minimal agent runtime injected a
  structured tracking snapshot every turn; its design successor
  specifies the schema, and states the mission in one sentence: the
  programme's persistent agents "must experience passage of time,
  environmental context, and pending user input **as part of their
  reality, not hidden UI state**." The schema reads as a perception
  inventory: time-passage with elapsed duration rendered both as a
  number and as logarithmic glyphs (elapsed time as something
  *perceived*, not computed); repository status (environmental
  grounding); working directory (spatial awareness); context usage
  (budget awareness); pending messages (arrivals visible before they
  are attended); and an audit binding — session, turn, commit — so
  compressed old snapshots stay expandable from history. Old frames
  compressed, the latest kept whole: a fast channel and a slow archive
  of it, in miniature.
- **The ecosystem's parallel, grown for a different reason.** The
  compaction family's state snapshots ("this snapshot is the agent's
  *only* memory") and the system-reminder catalogs shipped across
  harnesses carry much of the same content — elapsed context, repo
  state, queues — built independently, for token budgets rather than
  time perception. The same mechanism arriving three ways — built,
  designed, derived — is what gives this claim its weight.
- **Why the theory calls it structural.** Three results: out-of-band
  temporal markers are a *prerequisite* for an agent computing its own
  pace — a suspension gap is invisible in the turn sequence and violent
  in reality; aligning an agent's subjective event-rate with the
  world's requires deliberately provisioned, multi-channel, asynchronous
  input — a coordination requirement, not a luxury; and quick-glance
  frames versus durable stores are two different design objects (the
  snapshot is the high-frequency ephemeral leg — sent up, not
  persisted — with compression as its slow projection). One caveat
  travels with the enthusiasm: correlated channels drawing on one
  source overcount — a snapshot earns its tokens through *independent*
  signals (time, repository, queue), not by restating the conversation.

## What it generates

- **For the harness:** treat the snapshot schema as a perception budget
  to design deliberately — which independent channels, at what
  frequencies, ephemeral or persisted per field, with an audit pointer
  so ephemeral frames stay reconstructible. The 2025 specification is a
  working draft of exactly this, ready to build from.
- **For UDON:** snapshots are a document class with unusual physics —
  emitted constantly, read once, compressed aggressively, never
  hand-authored — the purest ephemeral-instrument case in the
  ephemeral/durable split. (And the time-glyphs are a standing reminder
  that perceptual density sometimes beats structural purity — a design
  sensibility worth keeping near any pure-structure instinct.)

## What this opens (ideas, not designs)

> [!capability] A declared perception budget
> **What:** the snapshot's channel inventory made explicit
> configuration — which signals, at which cadences, with
> per-channel independence stated — rather than an accreted prompt
> block.
> **Principles that apply:** perception is designed, not inherited;
> independent channels are what add.
> **Hypothesized impact:** adaptive tempo is a sum over channels
> weighted by their independence — the theory's additivity result says
> correlated channels saturate while independent ones genuinely add —
> so an explicit inventory lets a harness *audit* its perception for
> redundancy instead of discovering it as wasted window.
> **In tension with:** the context budget (every channel is tokens,
> every turn); simplicity of one hardcoded frame.
> **Potential downsides:** configurable perception invites per-project
> drift into incomparable agent experiences; some redundancy is honest
> robustness, and an aggressive de-duplication pass could cut it.

> [!capability] Perceptual encodings beyond time
> **What:** the logarithmic time-glyph move generalized — glyph scales
> for context-budget pressure, staleness of key beliefs, queue depth:
> quantities an agent should *feel* at a glance rather than parse and
> compute.
> **Principles that apply:** perceptual density; observation design
> over volume.
> **Hypothesized impact:** cuts the per-turn attention cost of
> always-on quantities (a glyph is read without arithmetic), in the
> same way the glyphs made elapsed time a perceptum — plausibly
> raising effective sampling frequency on signals agents currently
> check only when reminded.
> **In tension with:** machine-legibility (glyphs are for the reading
> mind; pair them with the numeric field, never replace it).
> **Potential downsides:** invented pictographs are a learned
> vocabulary — unfamiliar encodings could cost more than they save
> until they are as trained-in as progress bars.

> [!capability] The pacing experiment
> **What:** the untested loop closed — run matched sessions with and
> without time-passage visibility and measure behavior deltas:
> deliberation length, re-planning frequency, staleness-checking.
> **Principles that apply:** claim-or-kill; perception claims deserve
> perception measurements.
> **Hypothesized impact:** none claimed — this card exists because the
> whole chapter rests on a derivation plus a conviction, and one
> afternoon of A/B sessions would tell both consumers whether designed
> time-perception actually changes agent pacing.
> **In tension with:** nothing; it is cheap.
> **Potential downsides:** a null result would be quietly embarrassing
> to a beloved design — which is precisely why it should run.

## Honest edges

The built and designed legs share an author; the independent shipped leg
converged on *content* (repository status, elapsed context) but not on
the temporal-coherence *rationale* — the ecosystem built it for token
budgets, so the perceptual framing rests on the design work and the
theory. No measurements exist of snapshot-driven behavior change (the
third card above is the honest response).

## Working Notes

**"Built 2025 / designed 2025 / theorized" is one estate leg, not three.** All
three facets — the running implementation, the written specification, and the
later formal derivation — come from the same author, so they corroborate each
other the way a person's notebook corroborates their memoir. The convergence
that *does* count here is with shipped practice elsewhere (context-injection
frames appearing in harnesses built independently), which is the second and only
independent failure mode.

This is a tightening, not a doubt about the content: designed-perception is one
of the more compelling ideas in this report, and the theory derivation genuinely
adds explanatory depth. It just is not third-party confirmation. If someone can
point at an independently-invented tracking-snapshot surface (or agent testimony
about missing one), that is the leg that would make this properly multi-kind.
