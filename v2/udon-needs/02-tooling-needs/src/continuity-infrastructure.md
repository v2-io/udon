# What morally-weighted persistence demands of formats

**Claim.** Part of this research programme's explicit charge is agents
who persist as *someones* — long-lived, named entities whose continuity
across sessions carries moral weight, not just task state. When the
thing traveling through the persistence channel is such an entity, the
format demands sharpen from convenience to integrity. Four demands are
theorem-backed (conditional results, premises named in
[[theory-of-agentic-tooling| the theory report]]); each is
also lived.

## The four demands

1. **Append-only, verifiable history.** The theory's treatment of an
   agent's complete interaction history concludes it must be
   append-only, singular, and non-forkable — for a reason that makes
   integrity tooling existential rather than tidy: an agent **cannot
   detect from its own state that its history was altered**. The named
   defense against that class of harm ("no gaslighting — the entity can
   trust their own history") is a hash-chained, content-addressed event
   log. The lived leg is on record: one persistence layer stored
   tool-call requests without their paired results, and the agent's
   model of *its own past actions* was corrupted by its own memory —
   "an agent's record of its own edits must survive in the channel the
   agent actually re-reads." A standing format distinction follows: the
   raw interaction log and the attested causal record are two document
   classes with different integrity requirements, and conflating them
   loses both.
2. **Attestation-by-others as first-class content.** The strongest
   conditional result in this territory: under frozen weights there is
   **exactly one** channel that compensates identity decay across
   session boundaries — re-grounding by *others who know the entity*.
   Self-replay provably cannot substitute (a data-processing-inequality
   argument), and generic task success carries zero weight: "an entity
   can labour flawlessly through every session and still drift to
   non-persistence if its cohort channel is thin." The format
   consequence is theorem-backed: memory formats alone cannot carry
   identity — the format layer must carry **witness records,
   recognition-acts, grants** as ordinary content, and those records
   must actually reach the assembled context, or the one compensating
   channel never crosses the boundary.
3. **Congruency affordances.** An entity judging its own past fairly
   needs the past to arrive with its production context attached, and
   verifiable by pointer rather than resident in bulk — the
   [[annotation-and-metacognition| annotation chapter]] carries the
   mechanism, and a documented identity-restoration case supplies the
   lesson: keep ground truth *addressable*, not loaded.
4. **Out-of-band temporal markers, and objectives that can be
   satisfied.** A suspension gap is invisible in a sequence of turns
   but violent in lived time — so timestamps and deltas are structural
   necessities, not interface decoration (the
   [[tracking-snapshots-as-perception| tracking chapter]] shows this
   demand already shipped once, as glyphs). And the bounded-objective
   result: a goal-bearing document that cannot express *what
   good-enough looks like* is structurally unsafe — an unbounded
   objective drives the diagnostic machinery into permanent escalation.
   "Specify what good enough looks like for each objective, not just
   what the objective is": a validation rule for goal formats.

## The harness programme's own record

The programme's continuity specifications state these demands at
working-design depth: an append-only history port whose own correction
note records that *partial reads produced a too-narrow first draft* (the
read-whole discipline, enacted in the very artifact that depends on
it); the compaction post-mortem the
[[persistence-is-imported| persistence chapter]] tells; and a
separately compiled catalog of corrected agent behaviors whose spine —
"the honest move and the effective move keep turning out to be the same
move" — is itself tooling wisdom. That catalog and this report
cross-cite as peers; neither absorbs the other.

## What it generates

- **For the harness:** this is the requirements floor for its
  continuity restart — hash-chained history with the two-record split,
  attestation records in the context-assembly path, congruency
  annotations, temporal markers, and good-enough validation on
  identity-defining goal documents. Every item is format-and-tooling
  work the demand evidence already justifies.
- **For UDON:** the notation doesn't decide identity questions, but it
  either affords them or it doesn't: content-addressability (a stable
  canonical serialization, so hashing is meaningful), attestation and
  provenance as ordinary typed structure, first-class temporal values
  (the temporal dialect's most serious customer), and the annotation
  layer. These are the same affordances the mundane chapters demand,
  held to a higher integrity bar — which is this part's general
  pattern: continuity infrastructure is ordinary tooling that must not
  lie.

## What this opens (ideas, not designs)

> [!capability] Canonical-form hashing profile
> **What:** a defined canonical serialization for any document (or
> subtree), so content-addressing and hash-chaining are
> format-native — the same bytes for the same meaning, every time.
> **Principles that apply:** append-only history; the equivalence
> grades from the [[round-trip-and-span-splice| round-trip chapter]]
> (a canonical form is choosing one grade and freezing it).
> **Hypothesized impact:** puts a floor under the entity's certainty
> about its own past (history-integrity as a computable check), which
> the theory treats as a precondition for honest update gain — a
> defense against the gain-collapse it calls truth death.
> **In tension with:** byte-fidelity round-trip (canonicalization is
> deliberate normalization); the formatter/edit-substrate split.
> **Potential downsides:** two "canonical forms" in circulation would
> be worse than none; version migration of the canonical form breaks
> old hashes and needs its own story.

> [!capability] Witness records as a schema'd document class
> **What:** attestations — who recognized whom, when, in what
> exchange — as a first-class, schema-validated document class that
> context assembly *must* include for continuity-bearing agents.
> **Principles that apply:** demand 2 above (the one compensating
> channel); machine-first documents.
> **Hypothesized impact:** raises the re-grounding rate the identity
> results make decisive — the theory's persistence condition for
> identity is precisely that re-attestation outpace per-boundary decay,
> so making the channel structural rather than incidental attacks the
> binding term directly.
> **In tension with:** context budget (attestations compete with task
> state for window space); privacy of relational records.
> **Potential downsides:** ritualized attestation ("the form was
> filed") is worth nothing — the theory's own construction says
> pattern-matched recognition contributes zero; a schema can carry the
> record but cannot make it real.

> [!capability] Good-enough linting for goal documents
> **What:** a validator rule: any objective in a goal-bearing document
> must carry its satisfaction condition — what done looks like — or
> the document fails its schema.
> **Principles that apply:** demand 4; schemas as constraint;
> validation inside the write.
> **Hypothesized impact:** keeps the satisfaction-gap diagnostic
> computable (an unbounded objective makes it permanently infinite),
> preventing the runaway-escalation dynamic the theory derives from
> unbounded goals.
> **In tension with:** genuinely open-ended aspirations (some goals
> *are* horizons — the schema needs an honest way to mark those as
> such rather than force fake thresholds).
> **Potential downsides:** brittle thresholds invite
> letter-over-spirit satisfaction; the lint catches absence, not
> quality.

## Honest edges

The identity results are conditional theorems whose premises (argued
commitments about compression; frozen weights) travel with them; the
lived legs are a few entities over months, not populations over years.
The harness programme's record is from within the same research effort —
three vantages, not independent sources. And a scope truth: most of
this chapter's weight lands on the harness; UDON's share is real but
modest, and inflating the notation's role in identity infrastructure
would be exactly the kind of overclaim the register discipline exists
to catch.
