# Freshness and atomicity: edits bind to the file as it is *now*

**Claim.** Three related invariants recur across every kind of evidence
that touches writing, and together they form the transaction discipline
of agent mutation: (1) **read before edit**, as a hard, code-enforced
gate — an edit is only meaningful against a state the agent has actually
observed; (2) **re-resolve at apply time** — addresses resolve against
the current file at the moment of writing, never trusted from cache;
(3) **atomic multi-site application** — a batch of changes either fully
applies or fully refuses.

## The evidence

- **Universal in shipping practice, with one especially sharp
  formulation.** The read-before-edit gate is enforced *in code* — a
  typed error, dedicated modules — across at least eight of the
  fourteen harnesses examined: a hard invariant, not a prompt
  suggestion. The sharpest shipped statement is the hash-anchored
  editor from the [edit-landscape chapter](edit-representation-landscape.md):
  its anchors are valid only for the file state at read time, and **one
  stale anchor rejects the whole batch** — freshness and atomicity as a
  single mechanism. One other harness lifts the same concern to its
  scheduler: every tool call declares the files it will read and write,
  and only non-conflicting calls run concurrently.
- **Lived.** An agent's first-person account of the multi-writer wound —
  two agents editing the same document, each blind to the other — plus a
  working convention that grew up in response (a lightweight
  "soft-claim" note staking a file before touching it). Concurrent
  multi-agent editing is a present condition, not a future scenario.
- **Designed.** The 2025–26 design work states the re-resolution rule
  verbatim ("paths re-resolve at write time; never trust cache over
  file"), and [the addressing exploration](../reports/addressing-exploration.md)
  hardens it into a composition rule: path evaluation for a whole patch
  runs against the *pre-patch* tree, compare-and-swap style, so a batch
  of edits shares one consistent addressing frame instead of each edit
  shifting the ground under the next.
- **Derived.** The [refusal chapter](errors-that-teach.md) already
  established that a failed operation must not half-apply — atomicity is
  what keeps the lesson of a refusal unconfounded. And the theory's
  analysis of forked, divergent copies of one artifact gives the deep
  version of the multi-writer problem: two writers over one document are
  two histories sharing a prefix, and reconciling them takes an explicit
  protocol, not hope.

## What it generates

- **For UDON's edit substrate:** the transaction in the
  [guarded-mutation chapter](schema-guarded-mutation.md) inherits all
  three invariants, and the failure vocabulary must keep **stale** (the
  file changed since you read it) distinct from **not found** and **not
  unique** — the repairs differ: re-read, versus re-derive the address,
  versus disambiguate. One early design idea remains above all of this
  as a known missing piece: structure-aware *merge*, with annotations
  accumulating rather than colliding — carried here as an open demand,
  not designed.
- **For the harness:** enforce the read gate in code, never prose;
  consider declared-footprint concurrency once multi-agent sessions are
  the norm; and surface staleness as its own teaching refusal — name
  the hypothesis to the agent ("the file may have changed since you
  read it") instead of letting a mysterious mismatch teach nothing.

## What this opens (ideas, not designs)

- **Freshness as a token, not a behavior.** Every read could return a
  freshness token (a content hash, a version mark); every write could
  require one. The read gate stops being a rule agents follow and
  becomes a fact of the interface — un-forgettable by construction,
  and the hash-anchored editor's insight generalized from lines to any
  addressable thing.
- **Staleness scoped to the target.** Text-level freshness invalidates
  on *any* change to the file. Structural addressing makes a finer
  question possible: did the *addressed subtree* change? A file whose
  unrelated sections moved on could still accept a guarded edit whose
  target is untouched — fewer false staleness refusals, which matters
  exactly in the multi-writer world where the file is always changing
  somewhere.
- **Claims as leases.** The soft-claim convention formalizes naturally:
  an advisory reservation over a path, with a lifetime, visible to
  every other writer. Whether it lives in the document, beside it, or
  in the tool layer is a design question; that agents already invented
  the manual version is the demand evidence.

## Honest edges

Atomic *multi-file* transactions remain the gap nobody fills — the
hash-anchored batch stops at one file. And nothing in the evidence yet
prices optimistic against pessimistic concurrency for agent workloads:
the soft-claim convention and the footprint scheduler are single points,
not a convergence.
