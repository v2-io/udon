# The balance sheet, and what the design probes ahead should answer

**What this chapter is.** Not a conclusion — an inventory arranged for
weighing. The stages after this report (capability prioritization, then
design decisions, then the tool pipeline itself) need three things laid
out with full information: the **demands** with their evidence strength
and measured cost of absence; the **capability inventory** this report
generated, each entry carrying its own grounding, tensions, and
downsides; and the **questions** each design probe must answer. The
weighing is theirs. Where this chapter ranks, it ranks *demand
strength* — how many independent kinds of evidence ask, how broadly,
at what measured cost — never build order.

## The demand ranking (strongest evidence first)

1. **Schema-guarded structural mutation** — every kind of evidence
   asks; measured cost of absence (recovery collapsing to one scenario
   in six without compensating infrastructure); a stated owner demand;
   a gap no shipping tool fills. It pulls paths, schema, spans, and
   round-trip at once — the organizing *customer* of the design
   agenda, not one feature among many.
2. **Stable addressing with loud, typed failure** — the long pole;
   nearly everything else consumes it.
3. **Partial-document honesty as a public surface** — verdicts,
   mid-stream state, prefixes that parse; the ecosystem pays a standing
   reassembly tax for formats without it.
4. **Reinjection-channel formats** — durable agent state,
   cold-start-reconstructible; the only cross-session persistence
   mechanism there is, with a lived wound as its cost-of-absence
   exhibit.
5. **Teaching refusals and description-as-teaching** as the pervasive
   error contract — cheap everywhere once adopted; the report's
   strongest cross-evidence lock.
6. **Context-economy compatibility** — compact, self-describing,
   addressable payloads that survive the spill/defer/prune machinery.
7. **The headless contract** for every CLI either consumer ships — a
   floor, not a differentiator.

## The capability inventory (the balanceable half)

The ranking above weighs *demands*. The report's other product is the
**capability cards and ✦-marked proposals** scattered through every
chapter — each an affordance that could answer some demand, each
carrying (by the methods chapter's convention) its principles, its
hypothesized impact in the theory's own quantities, what it stands in
tension with, and its downsides. Harvest them by skimming for
`[!capability]` and ✦ across the chapters; the tension links between
them ("in tension with: byte-fidelity round-trip…") are the beginnings
of the trade-off structure the prioritization stage exists to
navigate. Nothing in the inventory is decided; several entries
mutually exclude; that is what makes it a balance sheet rather than a
plan. Notable clusters, as an entry map: guard-and-transaction
capabilities (around the flagship demand); address-and-freshness
capabilities (paths, hashes, leases, staleness scoping);
context-economy capabilities (budgets, spills, focus questions);
continuity capabilities (canonical hashing, witness records,
good-enough linting); and human-surface capabilities (review-grade
diffs, use-the-product verification, bidirectional steering).

## What each design probe inherits (questions, not answers)

**The paths probe** inherits the
[[addressing-is-the-long-pole| addressing chapter]] whole, with
[[addressing-exploration| the addressing exploration]] as
its deep context. Decisive questions: the smallest in-document
reference form that is a *true* subset of the full path language;
where paths terminate in every value context (the forced
embeddability table); relational-first versus tree-first as primary
mental model (stress the one-day sample against prose-heavy and
append-only documents); and the anchor-kind space (relative /
absolute / home / document-root / project-root — the last already
shipped once in this programme, sigil undecided). Standing decisions
travel with it: cross-document addressing is in scope; the existing
reference form does not grow incrementally. The failure vocabulary —
not-found, not-unique, plural, stale — is part of the deliverable, not
polish. And one question added by a cross-family reviewer: are paths
strictly *necessary* for guarded mutation, or one targeting mechanism
among several? A weaker-but-sooner guard (exact-match targeting plus
post-edit conformance check) might exist; the probe should answer
rather than assume.

**The dialects probe** — the least-fed area relative to its leverage,
and this report's writing said so early. Entry points now on record:
the in-vivo typed-value experiment (wire the existing temporal grammar
in as a live sub-parser and let running code force the
define/compile/declare/invoke/error questions — the preferred first
move of every reviewer who considered it); the template product shape
(compile → interrogate for requirements → build) with UDON-as-context
pulling directives toward path expressions; the two-evaluation-sites
resemblance (log the unification pressure, don't unify early);
badly-typed values on an unbounded stream (what does a failed-dialect
event look like to a consumer that cannot accumulate?); mid-stream
reconfiguration; and whether bracketed and quoted captures are sugar
for dialect-typed captures — the reframe that may dissolve the
multi-line question entirely rather than answer it.

**The schema probe** runs *against* the
[[schema-guarded-mutation| guarded-mutation chapter]]'s transaction
shape: static versus composable or nested (the owner's own open
question); what conformance means on a *partial* document (compose
with the verdict channel); the guard's failure vocabulary as schema
output; the evolution demand (declared renames, read-time translation,
schema history — from the family that has lived without it); and
enforcement profiles (casual / careful / critical) as schema
*strictness*, distinct from schema *shape*. External anchor: schema-
serialization mismatch as the dominant real-world tool-fault class.

**The value-typing probe** — the frozen-bare-set-plus-envelope boundary
is already decided; what demand still has to shape: dispatch order for
unlabelled typed values under multiple dialects; who routes nested
typed values; and recognition-time versus resolution-time typing for
stream consumers. Runs jointly with the dialects probe or immediately
after.

## Sequencing dissents worth carrying (cross-family reviews, 2026-07-22)

Two product-strategy positions from reviewers outside this model
family, carried visibly rather than adjudicated here: (a) **near-term
value first** — teaching refusals, partial-document honesty, and a
distinct staleness failure class are shippable *before* the
paths-and-schema program lands; the demand ranking is a strength
ordering, not a build order that parks all value behind the long pole.
(b) **The human-verification surface is load-bearing, not garnish** —
plausible wrongness is the failure class nothing mechanical catches,
so the thinness of the human-side evidence is a risk to fund against,
not a sign of low importance.

## The probe discipline (learned the hard way, twice)

Probes run against *scenarios from this report's chapters* — the lived
situations, the affordance lists, the walkthroughs — never as free
essay prompts; their outputs are demands and evidence for the product
graph, never design pins (an earlier architecture effort in this
project pinned its shape before the demand work and was archived for
it; this report exists partly because of that lesson). And each probe
should name in advance what would *falsify* its favorite shape — the
counter-evidence discipline applied forward.
