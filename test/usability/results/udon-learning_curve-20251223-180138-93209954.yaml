  ## Context

  You're participating in notation design research. This is a one-shot
  interaction—you won't receive a reply, but your response will be
  reviewed by humans. Please prioritize honesty over any attempt to
  please; skepticism and criticism are valuable.


  ## UDON Reference

  ```udon
  ; UDON Quick Reference
  ; | = element, : = attribute, ; = comment, |{} = inline element
  ; [id] = unique identity, .class = classification (stackable)
  ; Indentation = hierarchy, plain text = prose (Markdown works)

    Welcome to **UDON**. This prose belongs to the article.

    The magic: |{em structured data} and prose |{strong coexist}.
    Links work too: see |{a :href #mixed-content mixed content}.

    |section[overview]
      :priority 1

      |definition-list
        |term UDON
        |def Universal Document & Object Notation

      UDON unifies data, documents, and configuration because
      most real content is |{em mixed}—not purely one or the other.

    |code :lang ruby
      # Code blocks preserve content literally
      puts "Hello, world!"

  ```

  Write a blog post with title, author, date, and two paragraphs

    :title Learning to Read UDON
    :author Alex Chen
    :date 2025-01-15

    When I first encountered UDON, I was skeptical. Another notation
    system? The world doesn't need more markup languages. But after
    spending a few hours with it, I found myself genuinely intrigued
    by its core premise: that most real-world content doesn't fit
    neatly into "data" or "document" boxes. A recipe is both. A
    product listing is both. Even a résumé blurs these boundaries.
    UDON's syntax feels natural because it doesn't force you to
    choose—you nest structured elements where you need them, write
    prose where it matters, and the notation gets out of your way.

    The learning curve is gentle. Attributes and IDs are familiar
    concepts, classes stack intuitively, and the inline element
    syntax—|{em like this}—fits into prose without breaking the
    reading experience. What struck me most was the small design
    choice to use indentation for hierarchy rather than requiring
    explicit closing tags. It reads like an outline, which is how
    humans naturally think about structure anyway. I'm not ready to
    abandon XML or YAML, but for documents that live in that murky
    middle ground between data and prose, UDON might actually solve
    a real problem.

  ```**What works:** The notation is genuinely readable. I didn't need to reference the spec constantly. The `|{em inline}` syntax is clever—it's visible enough to parse, but unobtrusive enough to integrate into sentences.

  **Concerns:**

  1. **Whitespace sensitivity is dangerous.** Indentation-based hierarchy has burned Python users before. What happens with copy-paste errors? What about mixed tabs/spaces? The spec doesn't address this.

  2. **Ambiguity around prose parsing.** When does text get treated as Markdown? The reference shows `**bold**` and `|{strong}` both exist—which takes precedence? Can I nest Markdown inside attributes?

  3. **No escape mechanism specified.** What if I need a literal pipe character? A colon in an attribute value?

  4. **Identity vs. classification confusion.** Why `[id]` syntax for unique identity when CSS already taught people `#id`? This is a missed opportunity for familiarity.

  5. **Scaling question:** How do real-world documents with deep nesting or hundreds of elements feel? The example is clean, but I'd want to see UDON in pain cases.

  **Suggestion:** Consider a formal grammar (EBNF or similar) rather than just reference examples. Notation design lives or dies on edge cases, and those need explicit rules.
