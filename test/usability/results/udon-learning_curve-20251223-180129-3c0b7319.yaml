  ## Context

  You're participating in notation design research. This is a one-shot
  interaction—you won't receive a reply, but your response will be
  reviewed by humans. Please prioritize honesty over any attempt to
  please; skepticism and criticism are valuable.


  ## UDON Reference

  ```udon
  |article[welcome].featured
    :author Joseph
    :date 2025-12-22

    Welcome to the project. Here's what we're building:

    |objective
      :priority high
      :status active

      A notation that lets **prose and structure coexist** without
      awkward boundaries. Notice how this paragraph belongs to the
      objective element, with its metadata above.

    The key insight is that |{em most documents} aren't pure data
    OR pure prose—they're |{dfn :id mixed-content mixed content}
    where structure appears |{em inline} when needed.

    |requirements
      |req[r1] :must Machine-parseable without ambiguity
      |req[r2] :must Human-readable without tooling
      |req[r3] :should Support Markdown conventions in prose

    That requirements block was structured data, but it lives
    naturally within the document flow.

  ```

  ## Task

    :title Getting Started with UDON
    :author Sarah Chen
    :date 2025-12-23

    I've spent the last week exploring UDON, and I keep coming back to
    one observation: most notation systems force you to choose. Either
    you get human-readable markup that can't express complex structure,
    or you get a rigorous data format that reads like a configuration
    file. UDON seems genuinely interested in refusing that choice.

    The moment that clicked for me was realizing the |{em pipe symbol}
    doesn't announce "now we're switching to code mode." It just says
    "here's a labeled container, inline with everything else." A title
    can be text. A date can be metadata. They don't need separate
    sections or ceremony. You write your thoughts, drop in structure
    where it matters, and keep going.

  ```

  ---**What worked:**
  - The syntax is genuinely readable. Even without prior exposure, the structure is clear: `|article[id]` as a container, `:attribute value` for metadata, nested elements with indentation.
  - Inline markup like `|{em text}` for emphasis feels natural enough—though it's heavier than `*text*`.
  - The philosophy *is* interesting: refusing the false choice between prose and data.

  **Concerns:**

  1. **Escaping and edge cases**: What happens if I want a literal pipe symbol in prose? The reference doesn't clarify. This matters for readability claims.

  2. **Learning curve is hidden**: The syntax *looks* simple until you need nesting, attribute syntax, inline vs. block containers. I'm unclear on rules (why `[welcome]` vs `:priority`? Why does `.featured` exist?). The reference example uses undocumented conventions.

  3. **Markdown compatibility claim**: The reference mentions supporting Markdown conventions, but `|{em text}` isn't Markdown. I'm not sure what's actually compatible.

  4. **Verbosity for simple cases**: For a basic blog post, UDON is reasonable. For a paragraph with three emphasized phrases, I suspect it becomes tedious compared to Markdown's `**text**`.

  5. **What's the parsing model?**: Is whitespace significant only for block structure? Can containers nest arbitrarily? Are there reserved words? These aren't answered.

  **Honest take:** This feels like a genuinely motivated design solving a real problem (mixing prose + structure). But "human-readable without tooling" requires more precision about what's actually allowed, because right now I'm inferring rules from examples. A specification would help—or this remains a neat sketch rather than a usable notation.
